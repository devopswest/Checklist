1~3~4~A|A1.|(a)|(1)~A suitable heading:
1~4~5~A|A1.|(a)|(1)|a.~The company name.

1~9~11~A|A1.|(b)|(2)~Audited statements of earnings (which may be presented as a separate statement or within a continuous statement of comprehensive income), comprehensive income (in one statement or two separate but consecutive statements) and cash flows, and changes in stockholders' equity (may be a statement or a note) for the two most recent fiscal years.
1~2~12~A|A1.|(c)~When there is a change in fiscal year, see FRP 102.05 for reporting and filing requirements.

1~2~15~A|A1.|(f)~Include notes and other disclosures relating to comparative financial statements presented for the preceding year(s) to the extent that they continue to be of significance or are otherwise required. If any reclassifications have been made, these should be explained.
1~2~16~A|A1.|(g)~Information in addition to that which is required may need to be furnished to keep the statements from being misleading; however:
1~16~17~A|A1.|(g)|(1)~Immaterial items need not be separately presented.
1~16~18~A|A1.|(g)|(2)~No financial statement caption should be shown if the items or conditions are not present.

No such reconciliation is required for financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. This reconciliation is not required if the foreign private issuer uses IFRS as published by the IASB. This checklist does not apply to financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in another country. When a US-style report is to be issued, refer to AU 534, "Reporting on Financial Statements Prepared for Use in Other Countries."
1~2~20~A|A1.|(i)~Registrants in the following categories should comply with the designated provisions of SEC regulations and in certain cases may need to prepare other checklists:
1~20~21~A|A1.|(i)|(1)~Registered investment companies. (Prepare ADC for Registered Investment Companies in lieu of the checklist for SEC Registrants.)
1~20~22~A|A1.|(i)|(2)~Employee stock purchase, savings, and similar plans. (Prepare ADC for Defined Contribution Plans.)

1~20~32~A|A1.|(i)|(11)~Foreign private issuers. (Refer to ADC Supplement for Foreign Private Issuers.)
1~1~33~A|A2.~<B>Classified Balance Sheets:</B>
1~1~34~A|A2.~If a classified balance sheet is presented:
1~33~35~A|A2.|(a)~For companies whose normal operating cycle is longer than one year, follow generally recognized trade practice when determining current and noncurrent items, and:
1~35~36~A|A2.|(a)|(1)~Provide an explanation of the circumstances and (if practicable) an estimate of amounts not realizable or payable within one year.
1~35~37~A|A2.|(a)|(2)~Disclose amounts maturing in each year (if practicable) along with the interest rate or range of rates.
1~1~38~A|A3.~<B>Consolidation and Combination Principles:</B>
1~1~39~A|A3.~<U>Note</U>: A parent and its subsidiary are allowed to file combined periodic reports in cases where (1) the parent owns substantially all of the stock of the subsidiary, (2) there are no more than nominal differences between the financial statements of the parent and the subsidiary and (3) the non-financial disclosures of the parent and subsidiary are substantially similar, if the combined Form 10-K includes certain other specified disclosures. These disclosures include, among other items, separate reviewed financial statements for each entity (in this context, the requirement is intended to apply to the primary financial statements), separate financial statement notes for areas which are different between the parent and the subsidiary (e.g., debt or capital structure), separate reports on disclosure controls and procedures for each entity, and separate CEO/CFO Certifications for each entity.
1~38~40~A|A3.|(a)~A difference in fiscal periods does not of itself justify the exclusion of an entity from consolidation. Where the difference in fiscal periods is not more than 93 days, it is usually acceptable to use, for consolidation purposes, such entity's statements for its fiscal period. If such a difference exists:
1~40~41~A|A3.|(a)|(1)~Expressly indicate the closing date of the entity.
1~40~42~A|A3.|(a)|(2)~Briefly explain the necessity of using different closing dates.
1~40~43~A|A3.|(a)|(3)~Give recognition, by disclosure or otherwise, to the effect of intervening events that materially affect the financial position or results of operations.
1~38~44~A|A3.|(b)~Consider the propriety of consolidating foreign subsidiaries that operate under political, economic, or currency restrictions. If consolidated, disclose the effects of foreign exchange restrictions on financial position and operating results.
1~38~45~A|A3.|(c)~Describe the principles followed in consolidation, including those followed in determining the inclusion or exclusion of subsidiaries. Disclose the circumstances involved in any departure from the general practice of consolidating majority-owned subsidiaries and not consolidating entities that are less than majority owned. Consider the guidance in ASC 810-10-25-2 through 25-14 that prohibits the consolidation of a majority owned entity when the minority interest has certain participating rights.
1~38~46~A|A3.|(c)~<U>Note</U>: Consolidation by contract is generally prohibited unless the contract provides for a controlling financial interest.
1~38~47~A|A3.|(d)~Disclose any material change from the preceding fiscal period in the entities included or excluded in consolidation.
1~38~48~A|A3.|(e)~Disclose changes in fiscal periods of consolidated entities that have a material effect on the financial statements, and indicate the manner of treatment.
1~38~49~A|A3.|(f)~Eliminate intercompany items and transactions in consolidated financial statements, and unrealized intercompany profits and losses on transactions with equity method investees. If eliminations are not made, state reasons and method of treatment.
1~38~50~A|A3.|(g)~If a consolidated subsidiary or an equity method investee reports a change in (or the elimination of) a previously existing difference in fiscal year-end with the Parent Company, report as a change in accounting principle. Disclose items required pursuant to ASC 250-10-50-1.
1~1~51~A|A4.~<B>Discretionary Accounting Changes:</B>
1~1~52~A|A4.~All discretionary accounting changes proposed by clients subject to SEC reporting requirements are required to be reviewed by PwC's Accounting Services Group or an SEC Services Partner, and approved by one of the individuals designated in PwC Audit 9820 <U>before</U> approval of the change is expressed to the client (see also checklist item K5, Preferability Letter on Discretionary Accounting Change).
1~1~53~A|A5.~<B>Professional Standards:</B>

1~81~83~B|B1.|(a)~<U>Note</U>: The SEC staff has indicated that the mere holding of cash or short-term investments in a jurisdiction where the indefinite reinvestment assertion has been made would not require classification as restricted cash in the balance sheet.

1~393~400~B|B17.|(g)~Balance Sheet Presentation of Income Taxes:
1~400~401~B|B17.|(g)|(1)~For classified financial statements, separate current and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities and assets into a net current amount and a net noncurrent amount. Deferred tax liabilities and assets should be classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting.

1~444~445~B|B20.|(r)|(1)|a.~Note that a statement that the contingency is not expected to be material does not satisfy the requirements of ASC 450-20 if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized may have been incurred and the amount of that additional loss would be material to a decision to buy or sell the company's securities. For unrecognized contingencies, the company must:
1~445~446~B|B20.|(r)|(1)|a.|i)~Disclose the nature of the contingency.
1~445~447~B|B20.|(r)|(1)|a.|ii)~Disclose the estimated additional loss, or range of loss that is reasonably possible, or state that such an estimate cannot be made.
1~445~448~B|B20.|(r)|(1)|a.|iii)~ASC 450-20-30-1 states that in circumstances in which a range of probable losses can be determined and no single estimate is more probable than another, the company should accrue the minimum amount. (The SEC staff believes that recognition of a loss equal to the lower limit of the range is necessary even if the upper limit of the range is uncertain.)
1~444~449~B|B20.|(r)|(1)|b.~Material components of the accruals and significant assumptions underlying estimates.
1~444~450~B|B20.|(r)|(1)|c.~Circumstances affecting the reliability and precision of loss estimates.

1~444~452~B|B20.|(r)|(1)|e.~Uncertainties with respect to joint and several liability that may affect the magnitude of the contingency, including disclosure of the aggregate expected cost to remediate particular sites that are individually material if the likelihood of contribution by the other significant parties has not been established.
1~444~453~B|B20.|(r)|(1)|f.~The nature and terms of cost-sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties.
1~444~454~B|B20.|(r)|(1)|g.~The extent to which disclosed, but unrecognized contingent losses are expected to be recoverable through insurance, indemnification arrangements, or other sources, with disclosure of any material limitations of that recovery.
1~444~455~B|B20.|(r)|(1)|h.~Uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims or solvency of insurance carriers.
1~444~456~B|B20.|(r)|(1)|i.~The time frame over which the accrued or presently unrecognized amounts may be paid out.

1~458~464~B|B20.|(r)|(2)|f.~Recoveries of a portion or all of an environmental liability that is recognized on a discounted basis should also be discounted.
1~442~465~B|B20.|(r)|(3)~Net presentation of an environmental or product liability (i.e., net of a claim for recovery) is appropriate only in those circumstances where a right of setoff exists, as defined in ASC 210-20-45-1. It would be rare, if ever, that the facts and circumstances surrounding environmental remediation liabilities and related receivables and potential recoveries would meet all of these conditions.
1~442~466~B|B20.|(r)|(4)~Additional disclosure requirements under ASC 410-30 in connection with environmental remediation liabilities:
1~442~467~B|B20.|(r)|(4)~Required:

1~466~470~B|B20.|(r)|(4)|c.~To the extent the criteria of ASC 275-10 are met (see checklist item G5, Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties) with regard to recognized losses, recoveries of losses or reasonably possible loss contingencies, indicate that it is at least reasonably possible that a change in estimate will occur in the near term.

1~466~473~B|B20.|(r)|(4)|e.~Reasons why an estimate of the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be made and the estimated time frame for resolution of the uncertainty as to the amount of the loss.
1~466~474~B|B20.|(r)|(4)|f.~Specific individual site information to the extent it is relevant to understanding the financial statements.
1~466~475~B|B20.|(r)|(4)|g.~Disclose the amount of remediation costs recognized, for each period that an income statement is presented, in the following detail:

1~479~486~B|B20.|(r)|(5)|g.~If an asset held for sale or development requires remediation to be performed prior to development, sale, or as a condition of sale, disclose how the necessary expenditures are considered in the assessment of the asset's net realizable value.
1~442~487~B|B20.|(r)|(6)~With regard to a business combination, if the company is awaiting additional information that it has arranged to obtain for the measurement of a contingency during the allocation period, the company should disclose that the purchase price allocation is preliminary. Also, describe the nature of the contingency and furnish other available information that will enable a reader to understand its potential effects on the final allocation and on post-acquisition operating results.
1~442~488~B|B20.|(r)|(7)~Environmental costs meeting the criteria of ASC 980-340-25-1, Regulated Operations, should be presented on the balance sheet as an asset and should not be offset against the liability.
1~423~489~B|B20.|(s)~Costs associated with exit and disposal activities, including certain one-time employee benefit arrangements, and certain costs incurred in a restructuring accounted for under ASC 420-10:

1~490~501~B|B20.|(s)|(1)|h.~The SEC has indicated that registrants should justify or explain more fully their accounting for restructuring charges. The following disclosures have been requested in SEC comments:
1~501~502~B|B20.|(s)|(1)|h.|i)~Provide a complete description of each component of total restructuring charges.
1~501~503~B|B20.|(s)|(1)|h.|ii)~Fully describe the timing of cash payments to be made under the restructuring plan and disclose when the restructuring plan is expected to be complete.

The discount, premium, or debt issuance costs shall not be classified as a deferred charge or deferred credit.
1~535~538~B|B22.|(f)|(3)~Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.
1~535~539~B|B22.|(f)|(4)~Disclose face amount and effective interest rate.

1~512~551~B|B22.|(l)~Mandatorily Redeemable Securities of Subsidiaries Holding Debt of Registrant.
1~512~552~B|B22.|(l)~<U>Note</U>: Registrants should consider the adequacy of disclosures about mandatorily redeemable securities issued by a subsidiary or a trust of a parent company when the subsidiary or trust holds as assets only debt instruments issued by the parent, particularly if the outstanding security of the subsidiary or trust is guaranteed by the parent and mirrors the cash flows of the debt of the parent held by the subsidiary or trust. The staff believes that disclosures in these situations often must be expanded to provide investors with a fair and balanced picture of the registrant's effective capitalization and leverage. Inclusion of the outstanding public security in minority interest, or as debt, with minimal disclosure of its characteristics is not adequate, particularly when S-X 3-10 is used for reporting relief for the finance subsidiary or trust. In those situations, the parent should disclose the subsidiary's outstanding securities as a separate line item in the parent's balance sheet captioned "Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable security of subsidiary or trust holding solely parent indentures," "Guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in Company's debentures," or similar descriptive wording. Notes to the financial statements should describe fully the terms of the securities and explain that those terms parallel the terms of the company's debentures which comprise substantially all of the assets of the consolidated trust or subsidiary.

1~80~556~B|B24.~<B>Other Liabilities:</B>
1~556~557~B|B24.|(a)~State separately in the balance sheet or in a note items not properly classified elsewhere that are greater than 5 percent of total liabilities.

1~566~569~B|B24.|(b)|(5)|b.~<U>Note</U>: The above guidance and disclosures in (b) above (ASC 405-40-50-1) do not apply to asset retirement and environmental obligations under ASC 410, contingencies under ASC 450, guarantees under ASC 460, retirement benefits under ASC 715, and income taxes under ASC 740.
1~80~577~B|B27.~<B>Non-Controlling Interest in Consolidated Subsidiaries:</B>
1~577~578~B|B27.|(a)~The noncontrolling interest shall be reported in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, separately from the parent's equity. That amount shall be clearly identified and labeled, for example, as noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries (see ASC 810-10-55-4I). An entity with noncontrolling interests in more than one subsidiary may present those interests in aggregate in the consolidated financial statements.
1~577~579~B|B27.|(b)~Classify as last item before "shareholders' equity" section or "redeemable equity securities/preferred stock" as applicable.

1~593~598~B|B29.|(b)|(5)~That a contract does not limit the amount that the issuer could be required to pay or the number of shares that the issuer could be required to issue.
1~593~599~B|B29.|(b)|(6)~For a forward contract or an option indexed to the issuer's equity shares, the forward price or option strike price, the number of issuer's shares to which the contract is indexed, and the settlement date or dates of the contract.
1~587~600~B|B29.|(c)~If an entity has no equity instruments outstanding, but has financial instruments in the form of shares, all of which are mandatorily redeemable financial instruments required to be reclassified as liabilities:
1~600~601~B|B29.|(c)|(1)~Disclose those instruments as shares subject to mandatory redemption in statements of financial position to distinguish those instruments from other liabilities.

1~662~672~B|B33.|(b)~<U>Note</U>: The dating of retained earnings following a quasi-reorganization would rarely, if ever, be of significance after a period of 10 years. There may be exceptional circumstances in which the discontinuance of the dating of retained earnings could be justified at the conclusion of a period less than 10 years.
1~662~673~B|B33.|(b)~Treasury stock:
1~672~674~B|B33.|(b)|(1)~The cost of treasury stock may be shown separately as a deduction from the total of capital stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings or may be accounted for as retired stock.

However, when the restricted net assets of a smaller reporting company's consolidated subsidiaries are a significant proportion of consolidated net assets (not necessarily applying the 25 percent threshold test) as of the most recently completed fiscal year end, the amount and nature of those restrictions may be important to understanding the smaller reporting company's liquidity and its ability to pay interest and principal on debt or dividends. In these circumstances, the smaller reporting company should fully discuss, in MD&A, the nature of the restrictions on its subsidiaries net assets, the amount of those net assets, and the potential impact on the company's liquidity (see Item 303(a) and Instruction 5 of Regulation S-K). Disclosures within MD&A similar to the parent company condensed financial information specified by S-X 5-04 and S-X 4-08(e) may be necessary to facilitate this discussion.

1~692~700~C|C1.|(a)|(6)~<U>Note</U>: Consider the disclosure of gross transaction volume for revenues reported as they may be useful to users of financial statements. Such disclosure could be made parenthetically in the income statement or in the notes. However, if gross amounts are disclosed on the face of the income statement, they should not be characterized as <U>revenues</U> (a description such as "gross billings" may be appropriate), nor should they be reported in a column that sums to net income or loss.
1~691~701~C|C1.|(b)~Show excise taxes amounting to 1 percent or more of the total sales and revenues on the face of the statement, parenthetically or otherwise.

1~703~710~C|C1.|(d)|(3)~Segregate initial franchise fees from other franchise revenue if they are significant (either in the notes or on the face of statement of income).
1~703~711~C|C1.|(d)|(4)~Disclosure is desirable if it is probable that initial franchise fee revenue will decline in the future because sales predictably reach a saturation point.
1~703~712~C|C1.|(d)|(5)~Disclosure is desirable of the relative contribution to net income of initial franchise fees, if not otherwise apparent.
1~703~713~C|C1.|(d)|(6)~Segregate (either in notes or on face of statement of income) revenues and costs related to franchisor-owned outlets from revenues and costs related to franchised outlets, when practicable.

1~716~720~C|C2.|(a)|(4)~Cost of services.
1~716~721~C|C2.|(a)|(5)~Expenses applicable to other revenues.
1~716~722~C|C2.|(a)|(6)~The SEC staff will usually object to the practice of registrants excluding depreciation charges from cost of sales and showing depreciation as a separate item in the statement of income unless the caption "cost of sales" is accompanied by the phrase "(exclusive of depreciation shown below)." In addition, the line item labeled "gross margin" should not exclude depreciation.
1~715~723~C|C2.|(b)~Disclose costs and expenses incurred from related party transactions.
1~715~724~C|C2.|(c)~Disclose both the amount and the line item where significant shipping and handling costs are included, when they are not included in the cost of sales.

1~733~734~C|C6.|(a)~State separately any material items not normally included in checklist Item C4 above.

1~733~736~C|C6.|(b)~Amortization of intangibles should be classified as an operating expense. Impairment charges related to goodwill should be classified as an operating expense, as a separate line item on the income statement before the subtotal income from continuing operations unless a goodwill impairment loss is associated with a discontinued operation.

1~733~738~C|C6.|(d)~Gains or losses from the sale of businesses that do not qualify as a discontinued operation under ASC 205 should be reported as "other general expenses." Any material item should be stated separately. In a "two-step" income statement format, the SEC staff would not object to classification of such gains or losses within operations, but believes it is also reasonable to report such items as nonoperating.
1~733~739~C|C6.|(e)~Gains or losses from the sale of long-lived assets reported under ASC 360 should be reported as "other general expenses." In a "two-step" income statement format, such gains and losses must be included as operating income.

1~749~750~C|C7.|(g)|(1)~Display separate line items for the investment income from the investments in life settlement contracts that are accounted for under the fair value method and investment method, or
1~749~751~C|C7.|(g)|(2)~Present the aggregate of the investment income in life settlement contracts and parenthetically disclose the investment income from those investments accounted for under the fair value method that are included in the aggregate amount.
1~690~752~C|C8.~<B>Interest and Amortization of Debt Discount and Expense:</B>
1~752~753~C|C8.|(a)~The combination of non-operating income and expense is permissible so long as the individual amounts are not significant. That is, it is not the net balance which determines materiality, but the offsetting gross amounts. Further, the specific S-X 5-03.7 and .9 disclosure items must be considered in light of the fact that Regulation S-X prescribes general and not specific guidelines for the omission of these items.
1~752~754~C|C8.|(b)~For all periods for which an income statement is presented, disclose the following related to capitalization of interest costs:

1~770~778~C|C14.|(a)|(5)~The allocation to discontinued operations of other consolidated interest that is not directly attributable to or related to other operations of the entity is permitted but not required.

1~867~882~C|C21.|(g)~Disclose securities (including those issuable pursuant to contingent stock agreements) that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because to do so would have been antidilutive for the period(s) presented.
1~867~883~C|C21.|(h)~Disclose any transaction that occurs after the end of the most recent period, but before issuance of the financial statements that would have changed materially the number of common shares or potential common shares outstanding at the end of the period if the transaction had occurred before the end of the period.

1~894~895~D|D1.~<B>Format and Content:</B>
1~894~896~D|D1.~A statement of cash flows is required for general-purpose financial statements of all business enterprises. The statement explains the change in cash and cash equivalents during the period.

1~894~904~D|D2.~<B>Gross and Net Cash Flows:</B>
1~894~905~D|D2.~Generally, information about the gross amounts of cash receipts and cash payments during a period is more relevant than information about the net amounts of cash receipts and payments. However, for certain items, the net amount of related cash receipts and payments may provide sufficient information.
1~904~906~D|D2.|(a)~Items that qualify for net reporting because their turnover is quick, their amounts large, and their original maturities are three months or less (at date of transaction), include:
1~906~907~D|D2.|(a)|(1)~Investments classified as trading securities and not classified as cash equivalents.
1~906~908~D|D2.|(a)|(2)~Loans receivable.

1~915~918~D|D2.|(b)|(3)~Proceeds from issuing stock and outlays to reacquire stock.
1~894~919~D|D3.~<B>Cash Flows from Operating Activities:</B>
1~894~920~D|D3.~<U>Note</U>: In letters issued to specific registrants as well as a published sample letter, the SEC staff has taken the position that financing the sale of a company's inventory should not be treated as an investing transaction in the statement of cash flows; rather, such transactions should be viewed as an operating activity.
1~919~921~D|D3.|(a)~The SEC will not object to disclosures that do not specifically reference correction of an error where the classification for such transactions is changed, provided the company:
1~921~922~D|D3.|(a)|(1)~Correctly presents the consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented; and
1~921~923~D|D3.|(a)|(2)~Indicates that management's decision to change the classification of the cash flow effects of long-term customer receivables, including sales-type lease receivables, stemmed from concerns raised by the SEC staff about the previous presentation; and
1~921~924~D|D3.|(a)|(3)~Includes prominent disclosure that:
1~924~925~D|D3.|(a)|(3)|a.~Describes how the accounting for these transactions was historically reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, including an explicit statement that no cash was received by the company on a consolidated basis when the sale was made to the customer;
1~924~926~D|D3.|(a)|(3)|b.~States that the consolidated statements of cash flows has been adjusted to reflect the fact that there was no cash received by the consolidated entity upon the initial sale of inventory, resulting in the elimination of the effects of the intercompany transactions, and to properly classify cash receipts from the sale of inventory as operating activities;
1~924~927~D|D3.|(a)|(3)|c.~Includes a reconciliation of the amount previously presented for the affected line items to the amount currently presented for each period; and
1~924~928~D|D3.|(a)|(3)|d.~Discusses the effect of these transactions in the liquidity and cash flow section of MD&A.
1~919~929~D|D3.|(b)~Line item descriptors on the consolidated statements of cash flows should be consistent with those on the consolidated balance sheets and the respective footnotes. Companies should also consider the need for clarifying disclosure that:
1~929~930~D|D3.|(b)|(1)~Identifies where the cash flows related to the sale of inventory are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows; and
1~929~931~D|D3.|(b)|(2)~Explains the nature of the receivables/notes/loans and where the cash flows from these transactions are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

1~1557~1558~G|G13.|(f)|(1)~Its methodology for determining whether the reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, including, but not limited to, significant judgments and assumptions made. One way to meet this disclosure requirement would be to provide information about the types of involvements a reporting entity considers significant, supplemented with information about how the significant involvements were considered in determining whether the reporting entity is the primary beneficiary.
1~1557~1559~G|G13.|(f)|(2)~If facts and circumstances change such that the conclusion to consolidate a VIE has changed in the most recent financial statements, the primary factors that caused the change and the effect on the reporting entity's financial statements.

The reporting entity should provide qualitative and quantitative information to allow financial statement users to understand the differences between the two amounts. Such discussion shall include, but is not limited to, the terms of arrangements, giving consideration to both explicit arrangements and implicit variable interests, that could require the reporting entity to provide financial support (for example, liquidity arrangements and obligations to purchase assets) to the VIE, including events or circumstances that could expose the reporting entity to a loss.

If appropriate, an entity is encouraged, but not required, to provide such additional qualitative disclosures.
1~1638~1646~G|G17.|(c)~For fair-value hedges (i.e., derivative instruments - as well as nonderivative instruments that may give rise to foreign- currency transaction gains or losses - that have been designated as and have qualified as fair-value hedging instruments) and for the related hedged items, disclose:

1~1652~1657~G|G17.|(d)|(2)~a description of the transactions or other events that:
1~1657~1658~G|G17.|(d)|(2)|a.~will result in the reclassification into earnings of the gains or losses that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, and

1~1638~1667~G|G17.|(g)~The quantitative disclosures about derivative instruments may be more useful, and less likely to be perceived to be out of context or otherwise misunderstood, if similar information is disclosed about other financial instruments or nonfinancial assets and liabilities to which the derivative instruments are related by activity. Accordingly, in those situations, an entity is encouraged, but not required, to present a more complete picture of its activities by disclosing that information.

1~1638~1669~G|G17.|(i)~As part of the disclosures of accumulated other comprehensive income, pursuant to ASC 220-10-45-14 through 45-14A, an entity shall separately disclose all of the following: the beginning and ending accumulated derivative gain or loss, the related net change associated with current-period hedging transactions, and the net amount of any reclassification as earnings.

1~1672~1673~G|G17.|(k)|(1)|a.~Amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral that have been offset against net derivative positions in accordance with ASC 815-10-45-5.

1~1638~1678~G|G17.|(m)~For a non-hedging derivative, such as an economic hedge of debt, it is not appropriate to split the total change in the fair value of a non-hedging derivative for purposes of presentation in more than one line item in the income statement. As such, a company should present the entire change in fair value of the swap (including the periodic net settlement amounts) as interest expense to reflect its economic hedging relationship with the debt or as some other line item in the income statement such as other income or expense to reflect its speculative/non-hedging nature. In either case, the company should disclose the income statement line item in which the nonhedging derivative gains and losses are included.
1~1638~1679~G|G17.|(n)~When an embedded conversion option previously accounted for as a derivative under ASC 815 no longer meets the separation criteria (i.e., conversion options in convertible debt instruments that no longer meet the bifurcation criteria in ASC 815), disclose:

1~1988~1993~G|G24.|(a)|(1)|e.~An entity is not required to classify interest expense or amortization of leased assets as separate items in the income statement. However, unless the charge to income resulting from amortization assets recorded under capital lessees is included by the lessee with depreciation expense and the fact that it is so included is disclosed, the amortization charge shall be separately disclosed by the lessee in the financial statements or notes.
1~1987~1994~G|G24.|(a)|(2)~For operating leases, disclose in the lessee's financial statements or notes:
1~1994~1995~G|G24.|(a)|(2)|a.~Future minimum rental payments as of the latest balance sheet, in the aggregate and for each of the five succeeding years.
1~1994~1996~G|G24.|(a)|(2)|b.~Total future minimum rentals under noncancelable subleases as of the date of the latest balance sheet presented.
1~1994~1997~G|G24.|(a)|(2)|c.~Rental expense for each period for which an income statement is presented, with separate amounts for minimum rentals, contingent rentals, and sublease rentals. Rental payments under leases with terms of a month or less that were not renewed need not be included.

1~1999~2003~G|G24.|(a)|(3)|d.~The accounting policies for leases, including the treatment of each of the above components of lease agreements.

1~2013~2015~G|G24.|(a)|(4)|b.|ii)~Total future minimum rentals under noncancelable subleases as of the latest balance sheet, in the aggregate and for each of the five succeeding years.
1~2017~2018~G|G24.|(b)|(1)|a.~The components of the net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases as of the date of each balance sheet presented:
1~2018~2019~G|G24.|(b)|(1)|a.|i)~The future minimum lease payments to be received, with separate deductions for:
1~2019~2020~G|G24.|(b)|(1)|a.|i)|1)~Amounts representing executory costs (including profit thereon) included in the minimum lease payments.
1~2019~2021~G|G24.|(b)|(1)|a.|i)|2)~Accumulated allowance for uncollectible minimum lease payments receivable.

1~2017~2026~G|G24.|(b)|(1)|c.~Total contingent rentals included in income for each period for which an income statement is presented.
1~2027~2028~G|G24.|(b)|(2)|a.~The cost and carrying amount, if different, of property on lease or held for leasing by major classes of property according to nature or function, and the amount of accumulated depreciation in total as of the date of the latest balance sheet presented.
1~2027~2029~G|G24.|(b)|(2)|b.~Minimum future rentals on noncancelable leases as of the date of the latest balance sheet presented in the aggregate and for each of the five succeeding fiscal years.
1~2027~2030~G|G24.|(b)|(2)|c.~Total contingent rentals included in income for each period for which an income statement is presented.
1~2031~2032~G|G24.|(b)|(3)|a.~Disclose the components of the company's net investment in leveraged leases in the notes.
1~2031~2033~G|G24.|(b)|(3)|b.~For purposes of presenting the investment in a leveraged lease in the lessor's balance sheet, the amount of related deferred taxes shall be presented separately (from the remainder of the net investment). In the income statement or the notes, separate presentation (from each other) shall be made of pretax income from the leveraged lease, the tax effect of pretax income, and the amount of investment tax credit recognized as income during the period.
1~2035~2036~G|G25.|(a)|(1)~If an accrual is made, disclose the nature and amount of the accrual if necessary for the financial statements not to be misleading.
1~2035~2037~G|G25.|(a)|(2)~Provide additional disclosures for loss contingencies to ensure that the financial statements are not misleading and provide readers with the range of reasonably possible outcomes that could materially impact the financial statements, including:
1~2037~2038~G|G25.|(a)|(2)|a.~Circumstances affecting the reliability and precision of loss estimates.
1~2037~2039~G|G25.|(a)|(2)|b.~The extent to which unasserted claims are reflected in any accrual or may affect the magnitude of the contingency.
1~2037~2040~G|G25.|(a)|(2)|c.~Uncertainties with respect to joint and several liability that may affect the magnitude of the contingency, including disclosure of the aggregate expected cost to remediate particular sites that are individually material if the likelihood of contribution by the other significant parties has not been established.
1~2037~2041~G|G25.|(a)|(2)|d.~Disclosure of the nature and terms of cost-sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties.
1~2037~2042~G|G25.|(a)|(2)|e.~The extent to which disclosed, but unrecognized contingent losses are expected to be recoverable through insurance, indemnification arrangements, or other sources, with disclosure of any material limitations of that recovery.
1~2037~2043~G|G25.|(a)|(2)|f.~Uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims or solvency of insurance carriers. The SEC staff believes there is a rebuttable presumption that no asset should be recognized for a claim for recovery from a party that is asserting that it is not liable to indemnify the registrant. Registrants that overcome that presumption should disclose the amount of recorded recoveries that are being contested and discuss the reasons for concluding that the amounts are probable of recovery.
1~2037~2044~G|G25.|(a)|(2)|g.~The time frame over which the accrued or presently unrecognized amounts may be paid out.
1~2037~2045~G|G25.|(a)|(2)|h.~Material components of the accruals and significant assumptions underlying estimates.
1~2037~2046~G|G25.|(a)|(2)|h.~<U>Note</U>: Registrants are cautioned that a statement that the contingency is not expected to be material does not satisfy the requirements of ASC 450-20 if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized may have been incurred and the amount of that additional loss would be material to a decision to buy or sell the registrant's securities. In that case, the registrant must either (a) disclose the estimated additional loss, or range of loss that is reasonably possible, or (b) state that such an estimate cannot be made.
1~2035~2047~G|G25.|(a)|(3)~If a loss contingency arises after the date of the financial statements, but before those financial statements are issued or if no accrual is made or if the exposure to loss exceeds the amount accrued and there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred, disclose:
1~2047~2048~G|G25.|(a)|(3)|a.~Nature of the contingency.
1~2047~2049~G|G25.|(a)|(3)|b.~Estimate of loss or range of loss; or, state that such an estimate cannot be made.
1~2035~2050~G|G25.|(a)|(4)~The SEC staff believes that:
1~2050~2051~G|G25.|(a)|(4)|a.~It is inconsistent to disclose that the amount of a contingency cannot be determined and at the same time claim the ultimate outcome of that contingency will not have a material effect on the company's financial statements.
1~2050~2052~G|G25.|(a)|(4)|b.~Management should have a reliable basis for disclosing that a contingency will not have a material effect and that such basis should be verifiable.
1~2050~2053~G|G25.|(a)|(4)|c.~If a registrant concludes its disclosure by indicating that the ultimate resolution of the uncertainty is not expected to be material, that conclusion should extend to results of operations, cash flows or any other decision to buy or sell the registrants' securities as well as financial position.
1~2050~2054~G|G25.|(a)|(4)|d.~Registrants must present the gross liability and related claim for recovery.
1~2057~2058~G|G25.|(d)|(1)~Direct and indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others.
1~2057~2059~G|G25.|(d)|(2)~Guarantees to repurchase receivables.
1~2057~2060~G|G25.|(d)|(3)~Unused letters of credit.
1~2057~2061~G|G25.|(d)|(4)~Plant acquisition.
1~2057~2062~G|G25.|(d)|(5)~Guarantees relating to the sale of a business or operating assets to a highly leveraged entity.
1~2057~2063~G|G25.|(d)|(6)~Disclose nature of bank support of money market mutual funds. The SEC's Office of the Chief Accountant believes that on-balance sheet accounting for supported money market funds is not required if the sponsoring financial institution does not absorb the majority of the expected future risk associated with the money market fund's assets, including interest rate, liquidity, credit and other relevant risks that are expected to impact the value of the money market fund assets.
1~2064~2065~G|G25.|(e)|(1)~A guarantor shall disclose the following information about each guarantee, or each group of similar guarantees, even if the likelihood of the guarantor's having to make any payments under the guarantee is remote:
1~2065~2066~G|G25.|(e)|(1)|a.~The nature of the guarantee, including the approximate term of the guarantee, how the guarantee arose, and the events or circumstances that would require the guarantor to perform under the guarantee.
1~2065~2067~G|G25.|(e)|(1)|b.~The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted) the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee. That maximum potential amount of future payments shall not be reduced by the effect of any amounts that may possibly be recovered under recourse or collateralization provisions in the guarantee. If the terms of the guarantee provide for no limitation to the maximum potential future payments under the guarantee, that fact shall be disclosed. If the guarantor is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under its guarantee, the guarantor shall disclose the reasons why it cannot estimate the maximum potential amount.
1~2065~2068~G|G25.|(e)|(1)|c.~The current carrying amount of the liability, if any, for the guarantor's obligations under the guarantee (including the amount, if any, recognized under ASC 450-20-25-2), regardless of whether the guarantee is freestanding or embedded in another contract.
1~2065~2069~G|G25.|(e)|(1)|d.~The nature of (1) any recourse provisions that would enable the guarantor to recover from third parties any of the amounts paid under the guarantee and (2) any assets held either as collateral or by third parties that, upon the occurrence of any triggering event or condition under the guarantee, the guarantor can obtain and liquidate to recover all or a portion of the amounts paid under the guarantee. The guarantor shall indicate, if estimable, the approximate extent to which the proceeds from liquidation of those assets would be expected to cover the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee.
1~2065~2070~G|G25.|(e)|(1)|d.~<U>Note</U>: Certain indemnification clauses are within the scope of ASC 460.
1~2064~2071~G|G25.|(e)|(2)~For product warranties and other guarantee contracts that are excluded from the initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of ASC 460, a guarantor is not required to disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments specified in (1)b above. Instead, the guarantor is required to disclose for those product warranties the following information:
1~2064~2072~G|G25.|(e)|(2)~<U>Note</U>: The following disclosure is also required for an indemnification clause in a software licensing agreement that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages arising from any claims of patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret infringement by the software vendor's software.
1~2071~2073~G|G25.|(e)|(2)|a.~The guarantor's accounting policy and methodology used in determining its liability for product warranties (including any liability, such as deferred revenue, associated with extended warranties.)
1~2071~2074~G|G25.|(e)|(2)|b.~A tabular reconciliation of the changes in the guarantor's aggregate product warranty liability for the reporting period. That reconciliation should present the beginning balance of the aggregate product warranty liability, the aggregate reductions in that liability for payments made (in cash or in kind) under the warranty, the aggregate changes in the liability for accruals related to product warranties issued during the reporting period, the aggregate changes in the liability for accruals related to preexisting warranties (including adjustments related to changes in estimates), and the ending balance of the aggregate product warranty liability.
1~2071~2075~G|G25.|(e)|(2)|c.~ASC 460 applies to extended warranties accounted for under ASC 605-20 where deferred revenue is recorded. The tabular reconciliation should include both the costs incurred and the settlement of such costs during a given year relative to the extended warranty programs.
1~2071~2076~G|G25.|(e)|(2)|d.~Consider disclosing not only the cost component of extended warranty programs, but also the revenue components, including the amortization of deferred revenue amount for the period.
1~2071~2077~G|G25.|(e)|(2)|e.~If a company has both traditional warranty programs and extended warranty programs, they may choose to present their general product warranty and extended product warranty liabilities in two separate tabular reconciliations or on a combined basis.
1~2064~2078~G|G25.|(e)|(3)~The disclosures required by ASC 460 do not eliminate or affect the requirement in ASC 825-10 that certain entities disclose the fair value of their financial guarantees issued.
1~2064~2079~G|G25.|(e)|(4)~Some guarantees are issued to benefit entities that meet the definition of a related party in ASC 850-10-20, such as joint ventures, equity method investees, and certain entities for which the controlling financial interest cannot be assessed by analyzing voting interests. In those cases, the disclosure requirements required by ASC 460 are incremental to the disclosures required by ASC 850-10.
1~2064~2080~G|G25.|(e)|(4)~<U>Note</U>: For indemnifications, warranties, and representations that are outside the scope of ASC 460, it may still be preferable to provide some descriptive disclosures, such as their nature and terms. The disclosures may be helpful to financial statement users to evaluate the risks and uncertainties of the indemnitor's business.
1~1137~2087~G|G25A.~<B>Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern</B>:
1~1137~2088~G|G25A.~For entities that elect to early adopt ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (effective for all entities in the annual period ending after December 15, 2016), an entity shall disclose:
1~2087~2089~G|G25A.|(a)~If, after considering management's plans, substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans, an entity shall disclose in the footnotes information that enables users of the financial statements to understand all of the following (or refer to similar information disclosed elsewhere in the footnotes):
1~2089~2090~G|G25A.|(a)|(1)~Principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern (before consideration of management's plans).
1~2089~2091~G|G25A.|(a)|(2)~Management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity's ability to meet its obligations.
1~2089~2092~G|G25A.|(a)|(3)~Management's plans that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
1~2087~2093~G|G25A.|(b)~If, after considering management's plans, substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern is not alleviated, the entity shall include a statement in the footnotes indicating that there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
1~2087~2094~G|G25A.|(b)~<U>Note</U>: Additionally, the entity shall disclose information that enables users of the financial statements to understand all of the following:
1~2093~2095~G|G25A.|(b)|(1)~Principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
1~2093~2096~G|G25A.|(b)|(2)~Management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity's ability to meet its obligations.
1~2093~2097~G|G25A.|(b)|(3)~Management's plans that are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
1~2087~2098~G|G25A.|(c)~If conditions or events continue to raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern in subsequent annual or interim reporting periods, the entity shall continue to provide the required disclosures in ASC 205-40-50-12 through 50-13 in those subsequent periods. Disclosures should become more extensive as additional information becomes available about the relevant conditions or events and about management's plans.
1~2098~2099~G|G25A.|(c)|(1)~An entity shall provide appropriate context and continuity in explaining how conditions or events have changed between reporting periods.
1~2098~2100~G|G25A.|(c)|(2)~For the period in which substantial doubt no longer exists (before or after consideration of management's plans), an entity shall disclose how the relevant conditions or events that raised substantial doubt were resolved.
1~1137~2101~G|G26.~<B>Income Taxes:</B>
1~2101~2102~G|G26.|(a)~A public entity that is not subject to income taxes because its income is taxed directly to its owners shall disclose that fact and the net difference between the tax bases and the reported amounts of the enterprise's assets and liabilities.
1~2101~2103~G|G26.|(b)~Disclose the following whenever a deferred tax liability is not recognized because of the exceptions to comprehensive recognition of deferred taxes related to subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures:
1~2103~2104~G|G26.|(b)|(1)~A description of the types of temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognized and the types of events that would cause those temporary differences to become taxable.
1~2103~2105~G|G26.|(b)|(2)~The cumulative amount of each type of temporary difference.
1~2103~2106~G|G26.|(b)|(3)~The amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration if determination of that liability is practicable or a statement that determination is not practicable. While ASC 740-30-25-14 prohibits recognition of a tax benefit for tax deductions or favorable tax rates attributable to future dividends of undistributed earnings for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognized, favorable tax treatment would be reflected in measuring that unrecognized tax liability for disclosure purposes.
1~2103~2107~G|G26.|(b)|(4)~The amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences other than those in (3) above (that is, undistributed domestic earnings) that is not recognized in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740-30-25-18.
1~2103~2108~G|G26.|(b)|(5)~The disclosures in (1) through (3) above should be made for certain "inside basis differences" of foreign subsidiaries related to revaluations that arose in fiscal years beginning before December 16, 1992, for which no deferred tax liability was recognized upon adoption of ASC 740.
1~2101~2109~G|G26.|(c)~The components of the net deferred tax liability or asset recognized in an entity's statement of financial position shall be disclosed as follows:
1~2109~2110~G|G26.|(c)|(1)~The total of all deferred tax liabilities measured in ASC 740-10-30-5(b).
1~2109~2111~G|G26.|(c)|(2)~The total of all deferred tax assets measured in ASC 740-10-30-5(c) through 30-5(d).
1~2109~2112~G|G26.|(c)|(3)~The total valuation allowance recognized for deferred tax assets determined in ASC 740-10-30-5(e).
1~2109~2113~G|G26.|(c)|(4)~The net change during the year in the total valuation allowance.
1~2101~2114~G|G26.|(d)~The approximate tax effect of each type of temporary difference and carryforward that gives rise to a significant portion of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets (before allocation of valuation allowances).
1~2101~2115~G|G26.|(e)~Significant components of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations for each year presented. For example:
1~2115~2116~G|G26.|(e)|(1)~Current tax expense or benefit.
1~2115~2117~G|G26.|(e)|(2)~Deferred tax expense or benefit (exclusive of the effects of other components listed below).
1~2115~2118~G|G26.|(e)|(3)~Investment tax credits.
1~2115~2119~G|G26.|(e)|(4)~Government grants (to the extent recognized as a reduction of income tax expense).
1~2115~2120~G|G26.|(e)|(5)~The benefits of operating loss carryforwards.
1~2115~2121~G|G26.|(e)|(6)~Tax expense resulting from allocating certain tax benefits either directly to contributed capital or to reduce goodwill or other noncurrent intangible assets of an acquired entity.
1~2115~2122~G|G26.|(e)|(7)~Adjustments of a deferred tax liability or asset for enacted changes in tax laws or rates or a change in the tax status of the entity.
1~2115~2123~G|G26.|(e)|(8)~Adjustments of the beginning-of-the-year balance of a valuation allowance because of a change in the circumstances that causes a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset in future years.
1~2115~2124~G|G26.|(e)|(9)~Disclose when it is at least reasonably possible that a material adjustment to the valuation allowance will occur within one year.
1~2115~2125~G|G26.|(e)|(10)~Companies often incur professional fees by working with attorneys and/or accountants to minimize income tax payables (e.g., implement tax strategies, resolve tax contingencies, or defend tax strategies). These fees do not represent payments to taxing authorities and therefore should not be classified in the income statement as income tax expense or benefit.
1~2101~2126~G|G26.|(f)~Components of income (loss) before income taxes as either domestic or foreign, and the components of income tax expense, including taxes currently payable and the net tax effects, as applicable, of timing differences.
1~2101~2127~G|G26.|(f)~<U>Note</U>: Amounts applicable to US federal, foreign, and other income taxes should be stated separately for each major component. Amounts applicable to foreign income (loss) and amounts applicable to foreign or other income taxes that are less that 5 percent of the total of income before taxes or the component of tax expense, respectively, need not be separately disclosed.
1~2101~2128~G|G26.|(g)~A reconciliation using percentages or dollar amounts of the reported amount of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations for the year to the amount of income tax expense that would result from applying domestic federal statutory tax rates to pretax income from continuing operations. The statutory tax rates shall be the regular tax rates if there are alternative tax systems. The estimated amount and the nature of each significant reconciling item shall be disclosed.
1~2128~2129~G|G26.|(g)|(1)~Foreign private issuers may not operate under a normal tax base rate such as the current US federal income tax rate. In such instances, reconciliations between year-to-year effective rates or between a weighted average effective rate and the current effective rate may be appropriate in meeting the requirements of S-X 4-08(h). A brief description of how such a rate was determined is required in addition to other required disclosures.
1~2128~2130~G|G26.|(g)|(2)~Reconciling items that are individually less than 5 percent of the computed "statutory" amount may be aggregated.
1~2128~2131~G|G26.|(g)|(2)~<U>Note</U>: If no individual reconciling item is more than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying the income before tax by the applicable statutory income tax rate, and if the total difference to be reconciled is less than 5 percent of such computed amount, no reconciliation need be provided unless it would be significant in appraising the trend of earnings. If the total difference is greater than 5 percent, the reconciliation is required even if no individual item is more than 5 percent.
1~2128~2132~G|G26.|(g)|(3)~To the extent that the impact of tax planning strategies on the financial statements is significant, if the tax planning benefit is recognized for financial reporting purposes, the impact on the effective tax rate should be disclosed in the effective tax rate reconciliation. If the tax planning benefit is not recognized for financial reporting purposes, consider the necessary disclosures for income tax contingencies. If income tax contingencies are provided for as part of the current income tax payable or as part of another liability where there are not specific disclosure requirements, the disclosure requirement of ASC 450, Contingencies, would have to be followed.
1~2128~2133~G|G26.|(g)|(4)~Disclose the aggregate dollar and per-share effect of situations where temporary tax exemptions or "tax holidays" exist, and briefly describe the factual circumstances, including the date on which the special tax status will terminate.
1~2101~2134~G|G26.|(h)~The amounts and expiration dates of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes.
1~2101~2135~G|G26.|(i)~Limitations on net operating loss and other carryforwards resulting from a change in ownership and/or potential limitations that would result if a change in ownership were to occur unless the prospects of such a change is remote.
1~2101~2136~G|G26.|(j)~Disclose if there is an indication that carryforward benefits would be lost because of failure to meet the "continuity of business" requirement.
1~2101~2137~G|G26.|(k)~Any portion of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which subsequently recognized tax benefits will be allocated to reduce goodwill or other noncurrent intangible assets of an acquired entity or directly to contributed capital.
1~2101~2138~G|G26.|(l)~If not otherwise evident from the disclosures required, the nature and effect of any other significant matters affecting comparability of information for all periods presented.
1~2101~2139~G|G26.|(m)~For each year for which the following items are presented, the amount of income tax expense or benefit allocated to:
1~2139~2140~G|G26.|(m)|(1)~Continuing operations.
1~2139~2141~G|G26.|(m)|(2)~Discontinued operations.
1~2139~2142~G|G26.|(m)|(3)~Extraordinary items.
1~2139~2143~G|G26.|(m)|(3)~<U>Note</U>: For entities that elect to early adopt ASU 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items (effective for all entities that are public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015), the extraordinary items are eliminated.
1~2139~2144~G|G26.|(m)|(4)~Items charged or credited directly to stockholders' equity, as follows:
1~2144~2145~G|G26.|(m)|(4)|a.~Adjustments of the opening balance of retained earnings for certain changes in accounting principles or correction of an error.
1~2144~2146~G|G26.|(m)|(4)|b.~Gains and losses included in comprehensive income but excluded from net income (e.g., ASC 830 translation adjustments and changes in the carrying amount of available-for-sale securities under ASC 320).
1~2144~2147~G|G26.|(m)|(4)|c.~An increase or decrease in contributed capital.
1~2144~2148~G|G26.|(m)|(4)|d.~Expenses for employee stock options recognized differently for financial reporting and tax purposes as required by ASC 718-740. An employee stock ownership plan and a stock option plan are analogous. Both are compensatory arrangements and both sometimes result in tax deductions for amounts that are not presently recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements under existing generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The tax benefits of both are reported as a credit to shareholders' equity.
1~2144~2149~G|G26.|(m)|(4)|e.~Dividends that are paid on unallocated shares held by an ESOP and that are charged to retained earnings. This is different from a tax deduction received for payment of dividends on allocated shares held by an employee stock ownership plan that represents, in substance, an exemption from taxation of an equivalent amount of earnings for which the tax benefit shall be recognized as a reduction of tax expense and shall not be allocated directly to shareholder's equity. (Only applicable to ESOP shares grandfathered by ASC 718-40 (SOP 93-6).)
1~2144~2150~G|G26.|(m)|(4)|f.~Deductible temporary differences and carryforwards that existed at the date of a quasi reorganization. All changes in the tax bases of assets and liabilities caused by transactions among or with shareholders shall be included in equity including the effect of valuation allowances initially required upon recognition of any related deferred assets. Changes in valuation allowances occurring in subsequent periods shall be included in the income statement.
1~2144~2151~G|G26.|(m)|(4)|g.~All changes in the tax bases of assets and liabilities caused by transactions among or with shareholders shall be included in equity including the effect of valuation allowances initially required upon recognition of any related deferred tax assets. Changes in valuation allowances occurring in subsequent periods shall be included in the income statement.
1~2101~2152~G|G26.|(n)~The SEC staff would insist that a registrant provide additional disclosures regarding the realization of its deferred tax asset in those situations in which the deferred tax asset comprises a significant portion of the registrant's total assets and/or stockholders' equity and it is not apparent that the registrant's existing level of income would be sufficient to realize the deferred tax asset. If realization of a material deferred tax asset will require material improvements in profitability, or material changes in trends, or material changes in the relationship between reported pretax income and federal taxable income, or material asset sales or similar non-routine transactions, the SEC staff believes that the registrant should provide sufficient disclosures in MD&A to inform the reader as to what factors and assumptions led management to arrive at its conclusion that the deferred tax asset would be realized in the future.
1~2101~2153~G|G26.|(o)~An entity shall make the following disclosures required under ASC 718:
1~2153~2154~G|G26.|(o)|(1)~When a company cannot recognize the windfall tax benefit because the deduction did not reduce income taxes payable, disclose the gross amount of its net operating losses and how much would be recorded in APIC when realized.
1~2153~2155~G|G26.|(o)|(2)~Disclose the entity's accounting policies related to intra-period tax allocation:
1~2155~2156~G|G26.|(o)|(2)|a.~Application of tax law ordering vs. with-and-without approach for utilization of tax attributes.
1~2155~2157~G|G26.|(o)|(2)|b.~Consideration of direct only or direct and indirect impacts of awards when calculating the amount of windfalls or shortfalls.
1~2153~2158~G|G26.|(o)|(3)~Disclose the election, if applicable, of the practical transition option for windfall tax benefits available.
1~2101~2159~G|G26.|(p)~In separately issued financial statements of an entity that is a member of a group that files a consolidated tax return, disclose the following (in lieu of the disclosure requirements noted in (a)-(o) above):
1~2159~2160~G|G26.|(p)|(1)~The aggregate amount of current and deferred tax expense for each statement of earnings presented and the amount of any tax-related balances due to or from affiliates as of the date of each statement of financial position presented.
1~2159~2161~G|G26.|(p)|(2)~The principal provisions of the method by which the consolidated amount of current and deferred tax expense is allocated to members of the group and the nature and effect of any changes in that method (and in determining related balances to or from affiliates) during the years for which the disclosures in (p)(1) above are presented.
1~2159~2162~G|G26.|(p)|(3)~Significant temporary differences.
1~2159~2163~G|G26.|(p)|(4)~Pro forma income statement for the most recent year reflecting a tax provision calculated on the separate return basis, if the historical income statements do not reflect the tax provisions on the separate return basis.
1~2159~2164~G|G26.|(p)|(4)~<U>Note</U>: A change in the allocation method should be treated as a cumulative effect type accounting change under ASC 250.
1~2101~2165~G|G26.|(q)~Interest and penalties:
1~2165~2166~G|G26.|(q)|(1)~Disclose policy on classification of interest and penalties in accordance with the alternatives permitted in ASC 740-10-45-25 in the notes.
1~2165~2167~G|G26.|(q)|(2)~For each annual reporting period, disclose:
1~2167~2168~G|G26.|(q)|(2)|a.~Total amounts of interest and penalties recognized in the statement of operations.
1~2167~2169~G|G26.|(q)|(2)|b.~Total amounts of interest and penalties recognized in the statement of financial position.
1~2101~2170~G|G26.|(r)~Disclose the following at the end of each annual reporting period presented:
1~2170~2171~G|G26.|(r)|(1)~A tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of the period which shall include at a minimum.
1~2171~2172~G|G26.|(r)|(1)|a.~The gross amounts of the increases and decreases in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken during a prior period.
1~2171~2173~G|G26.|(r)|(1)|b.~The gross amounts of increases and decreases in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken during the current period.
1~2171~2174~G|G26.|(r)|(1)|c.~The amounts of decreases in the unrecognized tax benefits relating to settlements with taxing authorities.
1~2171~2175~G|G26.|(r)|(1)|d.~Reductions to unrecognized tax benefits as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations.
1~2170~2176~G|G26.|(r)|(2)~The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
1~2170~2177~G|G26.|(r)|(3)~For positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within 12 months of the reporting date, disclose:
1~2177~2178~G|G26.|(r)|(3)|a.~The nature of the uncertainty.
1~2177~2179~G|G26.|(r)|(3)|b.~The nature of the event that could occur in the next 12 months that would cause the change.
1~2177~2180~G|G26.|(r)|(3)|c.~An estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change or a statement that an estimate of the range cannot be made.
1~2170~2181~G|G26.|(r)|(4)~A description of tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.
1~2101~2182~G|G26.|(s)~In the event that a change in an entity's tax status becomes effective after year-end in Year 2 but before the financial statements for Year 1 are issued or are available to be issued (as discussed in ASC 855-10-25), the entity's financial statements for Year 1 shall disclose the change in the entity's tax status for Year 2 and the effects of that change, if material.
1~1137~2183~G|G27.~<B>Share-Based Payment (ASC 718):</B>
1~1137~2184~G|G27.~<U>Note</U>: Refer to ASC 718-10-20 for the definition of a "public entity." An entity that has only debt securities trading in a public market (or that has made a filing with a regulatory agency in preparation to trade only debt securities) is not a public entity when applying this guidance.
1~2183~2185~G|G27.|(a)~Disclose as a minimum the following information:
1~2185~2186~G|G27.|(a)|(1)~A description of the share-based payment arrangement(s), including the general terms of awards under the arrangement(s), such as:

1~2186~2189~G|G27.|(a)|(1)|c.~The number of shares authorized for awards of equity share options or other equity instruments.
1~2185~2190~G|G27.|(a)|(2)~An entity shall disclose the method it uses for measuring compensation cost from share-based payment arrangements with employees.
1~2185~2191~G|G27.|(a)|(3)~For the most recent year for which an income statement is provided:

1~2191~2200~G|G27.|(a)|(3)|b.~The number and weighted-average grant-date fair value of equity instruments not specified in (3) a. above (for example, shares of nonvested stock), for equity instruments that were:
1~2200~2201~G|G27.|(a)|(3)|b.|i)~Nonvested at the beginning of the year.
1~2200~2202~G|G27.|(a)|(3)|b.|ii)~Nonvested at the end of the year.

1~2206~2208~G|G27.|(a)|(4)|b.~The total intrinsic value of options exercised (or share units converted).
1~2206~2209~G|G27.|(a)|(4)|c.~The total share-based liabilities paid.
1~2206~2210~G|G27.|(a)|(4)|d.~The total fair value of shares vested.
1~2185~2211~G|G27.|(a)|(5)~For fully vested share options (or share units) and share options expected to vest at the date of the latest statement of financial position:

1~2185~2214~G|G27.|(a)|(6)~For each year for which an income statement is presented, disclose the following information:
1~2214~2215~G|G27.|(a)|(6)|a.~A description of the method used during the year to estimate the fair value of awards under share-based payment arrangements.
1~2214~2216~G|G27.|(a)|(6)|b.~A description of the significant assumptions used during the year to estimate the fair value of share-based compensation awards, including (if applicable):
1~2216~2217~G|G27.|(a)|(6)|b.|i)~Expected term of share options and similar instruments, including a discussion of the method used to incorporate the contractual term of the instruments and employees, expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior into the fair value of the instrument.
1~2216~2218~G|G27.|(a)|(6)|b.|ii)~If a company uses the simplified method for estimating a stock option term, it should disclose in the notes the use of the method, the reason why the method was used, the types of share option grants for which the method was used if the method was not used for all share option grants, and the periods for which the method was used if the method was not used in all periods. Companies that have sufficient historical share option exercise experience upon which to estimate an expected term may not apply the simplified method.
1~2216~2219~G|G27.|(a)|(6)|b.|iii)~Expected volatility of the entity's shares and the method used to estimate it. An entity that uses a method that employs different volatilities during the contractual term shall disclose the range of expected volatilities used and the weighted-average expected volatility. At a minimum, the SEC staff would expect a registrant to disclose whether it used only implied volatility, historical volatility, or a combination of both.
1~2216~2220~G|G27.|(a)|(6)|b.|iv)~Expected dividends. An entity that uses a method that employs different dividend rates during the contractual term shall disclose the range of expected dividends used and the weighted-average expected dividends.

1~2216~2223~G|G27.|(a)|(6)|b.|vi)~<U>Note</U>: The SEC has stated that disclosure of the amount of expense related to share-based compensation might be appropriate in a parenthetical note to the appropriate income statement line items, on the cash flow statement, in the notes, or within MD&A. Registrants should avoid presentations on the face of the financial statements that give the impression that the nature of the expense related to share-based compensation is different from cash compensation paid to the same employees (for example, by creating one or more separate line items for share-based compensation or by adding a table totaling the amount of share-based compensation included in various line items).
1~2185~2224~G|G27.|(a)|(7)~An entity that grants equity or liability instruments under multiple share-based payment arrangements with employees shall provide the information specified in items (1)-(6) separately for different types of awards to the extent that the differences in the characteristics of the awards make separate disclosure important to an understanding of the entity's use of share-based compensation.
1~2185~2225~G|G27.|(a)|(8)~For each year for which an income statement is presented, disclose:
1~2225~2226~G|G27.|(a)|(8)|a.~Total compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements:

1~2185~2236~G|G27.|(a)|(10)~Disclose:
1~2236~2237~G|G27.|(a)|(10)|a.~The amount of cash received from exercise of share options and similar instruments granted under share-based payment arrangements.

See also item B33(b), Other Stockholders' Equity.
1~2183~2241~G|G27.|(b)~Disclose changes in assumptions during the periods presented in the financial statements.
1~2183~2242~G|G27.|(c)~Companies that followed the nominal vesting period approach (for either pro forma or recognition purposes) for awards with vesting upon retirement eligibility must disclose in their financial statements before and after the adoption of ASC 505 the following:
1~2242~2243~G|G27.|(c)|(1)~The approach previously followed for awards with retirement eligible provisions.
1~2242~2244~G|G27.|(c)|(2)~The change in attribution approach as a result of the adoption of ASC 505.
1~2242~2245~G|G27.|(c)|(3)~The impact (in quantitative terms) of applying the nominal vesting period approach versus the non-substantive vesting period approach for each period for which an income statement is presented, if material.
1~2183~2246~G|G27.|(d)~An entity that acquires goods or services other than employee services in share-based payment transactions shall provide disclosures similar to those required above to the extent that those disclosures are important to an understanding of the effects of those transactions on the financial statements.
1~1137~2247~G|G28.~<B>Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Information under ASC 715:</B>
1~1137~2248~G|G28.~<B>Defined Benefit Pension Plans or Defined Postretirement Plans</B>
1~2247~2249~G|G28.|(a)~An employer that sponsors one or more defined benefit pension plans or one or more defined benefit postretirement plans shall provide the following information separately for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Amounts related to the employer's results of operations are to be disclosed for each period for which a statement of income is presented. Amounts related to the employer's statement of financial position, unless otherwise stated, are to be disclosed as of the measurement date used for each statement of financial position presented:
1~2249~2250~G|G28.|(a)|(1)~A reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation showing separately, if applicable, the effects during the period attributable to each of the following: service cost, interest cost, contributions by plan participants, actuarial gains and losses, foreign currency exchange rate changes, benefits paid, plan amendments, business combinations, divestitures, curtailments, settlements, and special termination benefits.
1~2249~2251~G|G28.|(a)|(1)~<U>Note</U>: For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation. For defined benefit other postretirement plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.
1~2249~2252~G|G28.|(a)|(2)~A reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of the fair value of plan assets showing separately, if applicable, the effects during the period attributable to each of the following: actual return on plan assets, foreign currency exchange rate changes, contributions by the employer, contributions by plan participants, benefits paid, business combinations, divestitures, and settlements.
1~2249~2253~G|G28.|(a)|(3)~The funded status of the plans, and the amounts recognized in the statement of financial position, showing separately the assets and current and noncurrent liabilities recognized.
1~2249~2254~G|G28.|(a)|(4)~Disclose information about plan assets:
1~2254~2255~G|G28.|(a)|(4)|a.~A narrative description of investment policies and strategies, including target allocation percentages or range of percentages considering the classes of plan assets disclosed pursuant to (b) below, as of the latest statement of financial position presented (on a weighted-average basis for employers with more than one plan), and other factors that are pertinent to an understanding of those policies and strategies such as investment goals, risk management practices, permitted and prohibited investments including the use of derivatives, diversification, and the relationship between plan assets and benefit obligations. For investment funds disclosed as classes as described in (b) below, a description of the significant investment strategies of those funds shall be provided.
1~2254~2256~G|G28.|(a)|(4)|b.~The fair value of each major class of plan assets as of each date for which a statement of financial position is presented. For additional guidance on determining appropriate classes of plan assets, see ASC 820-10-50-2B. Examples of classes of assets could include but are not limited to, the following: cash and cash equivalents; equity securities (segregated by industry type, company size, or investment objective); debt securities issued by national, state, and local governments; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; structured debt; derivatives on a gross basis (segregated by type of underlying risk in the contract, for example, interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts, equity contracts, commodity contracts, credit contracts, and other contracts); investment funds (segregated by type of fund); and real estate. Those examples are not meant to be all-inclusive. An employer should consider the overall objectives in ASC 715-20-50-1(d)(1) through 50-1(d)(5) in determining whether additional categories of plan assets or further disaggregation of major categories should be disclosed.
1~2254~2257~G|G28.|(a)|(4)|c.~For entities that elect to early adopt ASU 2015-04, Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer's Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets (effective for all entities that are public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015), if an employer determines the measurement date of plan assets in accordance with ASC 715-30-35-63A or ASC 715-60-35-123A, and the employer contributes assets to the plan between the measurement date and its fiscal year-end, the employer shall not adjust the fair value of each class of plan assets for the effects of the contribution. Instead, the employer shall disclose the amount of the contribution to permit reconciliation of the total fair value of all the classes of plan assets to the ending balance of the fair value of plan assets.
1~2254~2258~G|G28.|(a)|(4)|d.~A narrative description of the basis used to determine the overall expected long-term rate-of-return-on-assets assumption, such as the general approach used, the extent to which the overall rate-of-return-on-assets assumption was based on historical returns, the extent to which adjustments were made to those historical returns in order to reflect expectations of future returns, and how those adjustments were determined. The description should consider the classes of assets as described in (b) above, as appropriate.
1~2254~2259~G|G28.|(a)|(4)|e.~Information that enables users of financial statements to assess the inputs and valuation techniques used to develop fair value measurements of plan assets at the reporting date. For fair value measurements using significant observable inputs, an employer shall disclose the effect of the measurements on changes in plan assets for the period. To meet those objectives, the employer shall disclose the following information for each class of plan assets disclosed pursuant to (b) above for each annual period:

1~2381~2392~G|G29.|(c)|(9)~<U>Note</U>: For entities that elect to early adopt ASU 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items (effective for all entities that are public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015), the extraordinary items are eliminated.
1~2381~2393~G|G29.|(c)|(10)~Significant non-cash items other than depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense.

1~2397~2401~G|G29.|(e)|(3)~The nature of any differences between the measurements of the reportable segments' assets and the enterprise's consolidated assets. Those differences could include accounting policies and policies for allocation of jointly used assets that are necessary for an understanding of the reported segment information.
1~2397~2402~G|G29.|(e)|(4)~The nature of any changes from prior periods in the measurement methods used to determine reported segment profit or loss and the effect, if any, of those changes on the measure of segment profit or loss.
1~2397~2403~G|G29.|(e)|(5)~The nature and effect of any asymmetrical allocations to segments. For example, an enterprise might allocate depreciation expense to a segment without allocating the related depreciable assets to that segment.
1~2404~2405~G|G29.|(f)|(1)~Total reportable segments revenues to the enterprise's consolidated revenues.
1~2404~2406~G|G29.|(f)|(2)~The total reportable segments measures of profit or loss to the enterprise's consolidated income before income taxes, extraordinary items, discontinued operations, and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. (If an enterprise allocates items such as income taxes and extraordinary items to segments, the enterprise may choose to reconcile the total of the segments measures of profit or loss to consolidated income after those items.)
1~2404~2407~G|G29.|(f)|(2)~<U>Note</U>: For entities that elect to early adopt ASU 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items (effective for all entities that are public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015), the extraordinary items are eliminated.
1~2404~2408~G|G29.|(f)|(3)~The total reportable segments assets to the enterprise's consolidated assets.

1~2419~2423~G|G29.|(j)|(3)|c.~<U>Note</U>: ASC 280 does not define what should be included in long-lived assets for purposes of the above disclosure. While judgment and flexibility are required, the intent of the guidance is to provide information about long-lived assets that are potentially at greater risk because they are difficult to move and are relatively illiquid. ASC 280-10-55-23 indicates this would include hard assets that cannot be readily removed, but generally would exclude many intangible assets.
1~1137~2427~G|G30.~<B>Related Parties:</B>
1~2427~2428~G|G30.|(a)~For related party transactions, disclose:
1~2428~2429~G|G30.|(a)|(1)~Nature of relationship. (Disclose name of related party, if necessary, to understand the relationship.)

1~2428~2437~G|G30.|(a)|(8)~<U>Note</U>: Advances to shareholders should generally be reflected as a reduction of equity. There may be some circumstances where it would be acceptable to reflect them as assets. Accounting for advances to shareholders is highly judgmental and it is critical that we ascertain that amounts recorded as assets are fully recoverable and that the shareholder intends to repay them within a reasonable time frame.
1~2427~2438~G|G30.|(b)~If common ownership or management control exists that could result in operating results or financial position of the reporting enterprise significantly different from those that would have been obtained if the enterprise were autonomous, disclose the nature of the control relationship (even if there were no transactions between the enterprises).

1~2441~2443~G|G30.|(e)|(2)~The method of accounting for the transfer of net assets or exchange of equity interests.
1~2427~2444~G|G30.|(f)~The nature of and effects on earnings per share (EPS) of nonrecurring intra-entity transactions involving long-term assets and liabilities is not required to be eliminated under the guidance in ASC 805-50-45-3 but shall be disclosed.

1~1137~2450~G|G32.~<B>Reporting the Effects of Changing Prices:</B>
1~1137~2451~G|G32.~Companies are encouraged, but not required, to disclose supplementary information about the effects of changing prices. Companies that wish to provide these disclosures can either follow the guidance included in ASC 255 or use other forms of disclosures.

1~2452~2456~G|G33.|(b)~<U>Note 1</U>: An entity may choose how to classify BI insurance recoveries in the statement of operations, as long as that classification is not contrary to existing generally accepted accounting principles.
1~2452~2457~G|G33.|(b)~<U>Note 2</U>: For entities that elect to early adopt ASU 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items (effective for all entities that are public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015), the extraordinary items are eliminated.
1~1137~2458~G|G34.~<B>Energy Trading Activities and Contracts:</B>

1~2461~2464~G|G35.|(b)~Extraordinary, unusual, or infrequently occurring items.
1~2461~2465~G|G35.|(b)~<U>Note</U>: For entities that elect to early adopt ASU 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items (effective for all entities that are public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015), the extraordinary items are eliminated.
1~2461~2466~G|G35.|(c)~Aggregate effect of year-end adjustments which are material to the fourth quarter results.
1~2461~2467~G|G35.|(d)~The effect of an accounting change during the fourth quarter on interim period results should be disclosed in the annual financial statements for the fiscal year in which the change is made as required by ASC 270-10-45-12 through 45-14 or by ASC 250-10-45-15.
1~2461~2468~G|G35.|(d)~(Also refer to checklist Item 1 of Section H, which applies only to certain registrants.)
1~1137~2469~G|G36.~<B>Subsequent Events:</B>
1~2469~2470~G|G36.|(a)~The standard requires the following disclosures:
1~2470~2471~G|G36.|(a)|(1)~Some nonrecognized subsequent events may be of such a nature that they must be disclosed to keep the financial statements from being misleading. For such events, an entity should disclose the following:

1~2471~2473~G|G36.|(a)|(1)|b.~An estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made.
1~2470~2474~G|G36.|(a)|(2)~An entity also should consider supplementing the historical financial statements with pro forma financial data. Occasionally, a subsequent event may be so significant that disclosure can best be made by means of pro forma financial data. Such data shall give effect to the event as if it had occurred on the balance sheet date. In some situations, an entity also should consider presenting pro forma statements, usually a balance sheet only, in columnar form on the face of the historical statements.
1~1137~2475~G|G37.~<B>Illegal Acts:</B>
1~1137~2476~G|G37.~Consider disclosure of the potential effect of an illegal act, including:
1~2475~2477~G|G37.|(a)~Loss contingencies such as threat of expropriation of assets, enforced discontinuance of operations in a foreign country, or possible litigation.

1~1137~2482~G|G38.~<U>Note</U>: The quantitative disclosures required shall be presented using a tabular format.
1~2481~2483~G|G38.|(a)~A reporting entity shall disclose information that helps users of its financial statements assess both of the following:
1~2483~2484~G|G38.|(a)|(1)~For assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis in the statement of financial position after initial recognition, the valuation techniques and inputs used to develop those measurements.
1~2483~2485~G|G38.|(a)|(2)~For recurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), the effect of the measurements on earnings (or changes in net assets) or other comprehensive income for the period.
1~2481~2486~G|G38.|(b)~Disclose, at a minimum, the following for each class of assets and liabilities (see ASC 820-10-50-2B for information on determining appropriate classes of assets and liabilities) measured at fair value (including measurements based on fair value within the scope of ASC 820) in the statement of financial position after initial recognition:
1~2486~2487~G|G38.|(b)|(1)~For recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements, the fair value measurement at the end of the reporting period, and for nonrecurring fair value measurements, the reasons for the measurement.
1~2486~2488~G|G38.|(b)|(2)~For entities that elect to early adopt ASU 2015-10, Technical Corrections and Improvements (effective for all entities that are public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015), instead of disclosing (1) above, for recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements, disclose the fair value measurements at the end of the reporting period, and, for nonrecurring fair value measurements, disclose the fair value measurement at the relevant measurement date and the reasons for the measurement. For nonrecurring measurements estimated at a date during the reporting period other than the end of the reporting period, clearly indicate that the fair value information presented is not as of the period's end as well as the date or period that the measurement was taken.
1~2486~2489~G|G38.|(b)|(3)~For recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements, the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurements are categorized in their entirety (Level 1, 2, or 3).

Transfers into each level shall be disclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of each level.
1~2486~2491~G|G38.|(b)|(5)~For recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements categorized within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, a description of the valuation technique(s) and the inputs used in the fair value measurement. If there has been a change in valuation technique (for example, changing from a market approach to an income approach, or the use of an additional valuation technique), disclose that change and the reason(s) for making it.
1~2486~2492~G|G38.|(b)|(6)~For fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, provide quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement. A reporting entity is not required to create quantitative information to comply with this disclosure requirement if quantitative unobservable inputs are not developed by the reporting entity when measuring fair value (for example, when a reporting entity uses prices from prior transactions or third-party pricing information without adjustment). However, when providing this disclosure, a reporting entity cannot ignore quantitative unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement and are reasonably available to the reporting entity.
1~2486~2493~G|G38.|(b)|(6)~<U>Note</U>: The quantitative disclosures about significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are not required for fair value measurements related to the financial accounting and reporting for goodwill after its initial recognition in a business combination.
1~2486~2494~G|G38.|(b)|(7)~For recurring fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, a reconciliation from the opening balances to the closing balances, disclosing separately changes during the period attributable to the following:

1~2494~2496~G|G38.|(b)|(7)|b.~Total gains or losses for the period recognized in other comprehensive income, and the line item(s) in other comprehensive income in which those gains or losses are recognized.
1~2494~2497~G|G38.|(b)|(7)|c.~Purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements (each of those types of changes disclosed separately).
1~2494~2498~G|G38.|(b)|(7)|d.~The amounts of any transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the reasons for those transfers, and the reporting entity's policy for determining when transfers between levels are deemed to have occurred (see ASC 820-10-50-2C). Transfers into Level 3 shall be disclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of Level 3.
1~2486~2499~G|G38.|(b)|(8)~For recurring fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the amount of the total gains or losses for the period in subparagraph (6)a. above included in earnings (or changes in net assets) that is attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period, and the line item(s) in the statement of income (or activities) in which those unrealized gains or losses are recognized.
1~2486~2500~G|G38.|(b)|(9)~For recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, a description of the valuation processes used by the reporting entity (including, for example, how an entity decides its valuation policies and procedures and analyzes changes in fair value measurements from period to period). See ASC 820-10-55-105 for further guidance.
1~2486~2501~G|G38.|(b)|(10)~For recurring fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy:
1~2501~2502~G|G38.|(b)|(10)|a.~A narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs if a change in those inputs to a different amount might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.
1~2501~2503~G|G38.|(b)|(10)|b.~If there are interrelationships between those inputs and other unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement, a reporting entity shall also provide a description of those interrelationships and of how they might magnify or mitigate the effect of changes in the unobservable inputs on the fair value measurement.
1~2501~2504~G|G38.|(b)|(10)|b.~<U>Note</U>: To comply with that disclosure requirement, the narrative description of the sensitivity to changes in unobservable inputs shall include, at a minimum, the unobservable inputs disclosed when complying with ASC 820-10-50-2(bbb).
1~2486~2505~G|G38.|(b)|(11)~For recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements, if the highest and best use of a nonfinancial asset differs from its current use, disclose that fact and why the nonfinancial asset is being used in a manner that differs from its highest and best use.
1~2486~2506~G|G38.|(b)|(12)~A reporting entity should present classes of assets and liabilities based on nature, characteristics, risks, and the level of the fair value hierarchy. If a class of assets and liabilities requires disaggregation beyond what is presented in the statement of financial position, information sufficient to permit reconciliation to the line items presented in the statement of financial position must be provided.
1~2486~2507~G|G38.|(b)|(13)~A reporting entity shall disclose and consistently follow its policy for determining when transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred in accordance with ASC 820-10-50-2(bb) and (c)(3). The policy about the timing of recognizing transfers shall be the same for transfers into the levels as for transfers out of the levels. Examples of policies for determining the timing of transfers include: a) the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer; b) the beginning of the reporting period; and c) the end of the reporting period.
1~2486~2508~G|G38.|(b)|(14)~If a reporting entity makes an accounting policy decision to use the exception in ASC 820-10-35-18D, it shall disclose that fact.
1~2486~2509~G|G38.|(b)|(15)~For each class of assets and liabilities not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position but for which the fair value is disclosed, disclose the information required by ASC 820-10-50-2(b), (bbb), and (h). However, a reporting entity is not required to provide the quantitative disclosures about significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy required by ASC 820-10-50-2(bbb). For such assets and liabilities, a reporting entity does not need to provide the other disclosures required by ASC 820.
1~2481~2510~G|G38.|(c)~For derivative assets and liabilities, the reporting entity shall present the fair value disclosures required by ASC 820-10-50-2(a) through (bb) on a gross basis and the reconciliation disclosure required by ASC 820-10-50-2(c) through (d) on either a gross or a net basis.
1~2481~2511~G|G38.|(d)~For a liability measured at fair value and issued with an inseparable third-party credit enhancement, disclose the existence of that credit enhancement.
1~2481~2512~G|G38.|(e)~For investments that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent and are within the scope of ASC 820-10-15-4 through 15-5 (and that are measured using the practical expedient in ASC 820-10-35-59) and measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the period, a reporting entity shall disclose:
1~2512~2513~G|G38.|(e)|(1)~Information that helps users of the entity's financial statements to understand the nature and risks of the investments.
1~2512~2514~G|G38.|(e)|(2)~Whether the investments, if sold, are probable of being sold at amounts different from net asset value per share (or its equivalent, such as member units or an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed).
1~2512~2515~G|G38.|(e)|(3)~The fair value measurement (as determined by applying ASC 820-10-35-59 through 35-62) of the investments in the class at the reporting date, and a description of the significant investment strategies of the investee(s) in the class.
1~2512~2516~G|G38.|(e)|(4)~For each class of investment that includes investments that can never be redeemed with the investees, but the reporting entity receives distributions through the liquidation of the underlying assets of the investees, the reporting entity's estimate of the period of time over which the underlying assets are expected to be liquidated by the investees.
1~2512~2517~G|G38.|(e)|(5)~The amount of the reporting entity's unfunded commitments related to investments in the class.
1~2512~2518~G|G38.|(e)|(6)~A general description of the terms and conditions upon which the investor may redeem investments in the class (for example, quarterly redemption with 60 days' notice).
1~2512~2519~G|G38.|(e)|(7)~The circumstances in which an otherwise redeemable investment in the class (or a portion thereof) might not be redeemable (for example, investments subject to a lockup or gate).
1~2512~2520~G|G38.|(e)|(8)~For those otherwise redeemable investments that are restricted from redemption as of the reporting entity's measurement date, the reporting entity shall disclose its estimate of when the restriction from redemption might lapse. If an estimate cannot be made, the reporting entity shall disclose that fact and how long the restriction has been in effect.
1~2512~2521~G|G38.|(e)|(9)~Any other significant restriction on the ability to sell investments in the class at the measurement date.
1~2512~2522~G|G38.|(e)|(10)~If it is probable that the entity will sell an investment(s) for an amount different from net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as described in ASC 820-10-35-62, disclose the total fair value of all investments that meet the criteria in ASC 820-10-35-62 and any remaining actions required to complete the sale.
1~2512~2523~G|G38.|(e)|(10)~<U>Note</U>: For entities that elect to early adopt ASU 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (effective for all entities that are public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015), the disclosure required in (10) is superseded.
1~2512~2524~G|G38.|(e)|(11)~If a group of investments would otherwise meet the criteria in ASC 820-10-35-62 but the individual investments to be sold have not been identified (for example, if a reporting entity decides to sell 20 percent of its investments in private equity funds but the individual investments to be sold have not been identified), so the investments continue to qualify for the practical expedient in ASC 820-10-35-59, the reporting entity shall disclose its plans to sell and any remaining actions required to complete the sale(s).
1~2512~2525~G|G38.|(e)|(11)~<U>Note</U>: Plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan that are accounted for in accordance with ASC 715 are not subject to the disclosure requirements in ASC 820-10-50-1 through 50-9. Instead, the disclosures required in ASC 715-20-50-1(d)(iv) and ASC 715-20-50-5(c)(iv) shall apply for fair value measurements of plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan.

1~2596~2598~H|H1.~If the registrant has changed accountants within the past two years and the Form 8-K filed as a result of such change reported a disagreement or a "reportable event" regarding a significant accounting principle or disclosure issue, refer to S-K Item 304 to determine whether disclosure relating to the disagreement or the "reportable event" is required.
1~2596~2599~H|H2.~<B>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:</B>
1~2596~2600~H|H2.~<U>Note 1</U>: The MD&A is intended to give the investor an opportunity to look at the company through the eyes of management by providing both a short- and long-term analysis of the business of the company.
1~2596~2601~H|H2.~<U>Note 2</U>: The SEC expects public companies to demonstrate their ability and willingness to assume disclosure transparency in their Annual Reports. This is illustrated by the release of FR 60 and 61 in early 2001 and FR 67 and 72 in 2003, which expressed the SEC's views regarding MD&A disclosures surrounding certain high profile issues:
1~2596~2602~H|H2.~<LI> Critical accounting policies;
1~2596~2603~H|H2.~<LI> Liquidity and capital resources including off-balance sheet arrangements;
1~2596~2604~H|H2.~<LI> Certain trading activities that include non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value; and
1~2596~2605~H|H2.~<LI> Effects of transactions with related and certain other parties.
1~2596~2606~H|H2.~<U>Note</U>: In 2011, the Division of Corporation Finance began issuing a new form of guidance called "CF Disclosure Guidance Topics." These topics include disclosures related to cybersecurity risks, European sovereign debt exposures, and smaller financial institutions. CF Disclosure Guidance Topics can be found on the SEC's internet website at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cfdisclosure.shtml#cfguidancetopics.
1~2599~2607~H|H2.|(a)~As per the SEC FAQ on MD&A, the Staff encourages a focus on <U>analysis</U>, as well as discussion rather than a recitation of financial statements in narrative form and, in this sense, Staff encourages introductive section and tabular presentation of relative information to facilitate a reader's understanding.
1~2599~2608~H|H2.|(b)~Disclose forward-looking (prospective) information relating to material events (e.g., acquisitions, dispositions, and settlements of lawsuits), trends, demands, commitments or uncertainties that are both presently known to management and are reasonably likely to have material effects on the registrant's financial condition or results of operations, or that would cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future financial condition or operating results.
1~2599~2609~H|H2.|(b)~<U>Note</U>: Some companies have changed their accounting policies to recognize gains and losses that arise from measuring pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations earlier than the corridor approach. At the 2011 AICPA National Conference on Current SEC and PCAOB Developments, the SEC staff noted that when gains and losses are recognized only once a year in connection with the annual plan measurement, early warning disclosures in the quarterly MD&A may be warranted.
1~2599~2613~H|H2.|(c)~Discussion should generally provide information regarding changes in financial condition and the results of operations during the <U>three</U> most recent fiscal years. Discussion should also include sufficient explanation of the change in financial condition and consideration of whether reported trends and financial relationships are expected to continue. However, where trend information is relevant, reference to the five-year selected financial data appearing pursuant to S-K Item 301 may be necessary.
1~2599~2614~H|H2.|(d)~The SEC has issued comments discouraging registrants from providing rote calculations of percentage changes of financial statement items and boilerplate explanations of immaterial changes to these figures. Instead, the SEC staff encourages registrants to include a detailed analysis of year-to-year changes and trends.
1~2599~2615~H|H2.|(d)~The discussion should address the following topics:
1~2599~2616~H|H2.|(e)~Liquidity and capital resources:
1~2616~2617~H|H2.|(e)|(1)~Use the statement of cash flows in analyzing liquidity and present a balanced discussion dealing with cash flows from investing and financing activities as well as from operations.
1~2616~2618~H|H2.|(e)|(1)~<U>Note 1</U>: Cash flow presentations designed to reflect liquidity and capital resources should be consistent with the principles outlined in FRP Section 202.03.
1~2616~2619~H|H2.|(e)|(1)~<U>Note 2</U>: Financing the sale of a company's inventory should not be treated as an investing transaction in the statement of cash flows; rather, such transactions should be viewed as an operating activity and the effects of these transactions should be described in the liquidity and cash flow section of MD&A.
1~2616~2620~H|H2.|(e)|(2)~Discuss prospective information regarding the registrant's short- and long-term sources of, and need for, capital:
1~2620~2621~H|H2.|(e)|(2)|a.~Generally short-term liquidity and short-term capital resources cover cash needs up to 12 months into the future.
1~2620~2622~H|H2.|(e)|(2)|b.~Describe the sources of short-term funding and the circumstances that are reasonably likely to affect those sources of liquidity.
1~2620~2623~H|H2.|(e)|(2)|c.~The discussion of long-term liquidity and long-term capital resources must address material capital expenditures, significant balloon payments or other payments due on long-term obligations and other demands or commitments, including any off-balance-sheet items to be incurred beyond the next 12 months, as well as the proposed sources of funding required to satisfy such obligations.
1~2620~2624~H|H2.|(e)|(2)|d.~If the company's financial statements do not adequately convey the financing arrangements during the period, or the impact of those arrangements on liquidity, because of a known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty, additional narrative disclosure should be considered and may be required to enable an understanding of the amounts depicted in the financial statements. Companies should also consider describing cash management and risk management policies that are relevant to an assessment of their financial condition.
1~2620~2625~H|H2.|(e)|(2)|e.~Any ratio or measure included in a filing should be accompanied by a clear explanation of the calculation methodology. The explanation would need to clearly articulate the treatment of any inputs that are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring, or that are otherwise adjusted so that the ratio is calculated differently from directly comparable measures. If the measure is a financial measure, the registrant should determine whether the measure falls within the scope of the requirements for non-GAAP financial measures, and if it does, the company would need to follow the rules and guidance governing the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures in filings.
1~2616~2626~H|H2.|(e)|(3)~Disclose historical information regarding sources of cash and capital requirements;
1~2616~2627~H|H2.|(e)|(4)~Disclose an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows;
1~2616~2628~H|H2.|(e)|(5)~Disclose the existence and timing of commitments for capital expenditures and other known and reasonably likely cash requirements;
1~2616~2629~H|H2.|(e)|(6)~Disclose a description of expected changes in the mix and relative cost of capital resources;
1~2616~2630~H|H2.|(e)|(7)~Disclose indications of which balance sheet or income or cash flow items should be considered for assessing liquidity; and
1~2616~2631~H|H2.|(e)|(8)~Where a material deficiency in short- or long-term liquidity has been identified, disclose the deficiency as well as disclose (i) its proposed remedy, or (ii) that it has not decided on a remedy, or (iii) that it is currently unable to address the deficiency.
1~2616~2632~H|H2.|(e)|(9)~Disclose any known trends or any known circumstances, demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on the registrant's liquidity, increasing or decreasing. This disclosure threshold is lower than "more likely than not."
1~2616~2633~H|H2.|(e)|(9)~In identifying these trends, demands, commitments, events and uncertainties that require disclosure, consider:
1~2632~2634~H|H2.|(e)|(9)|a.~provisions in financial guarantees or commitments, debt or lease agreements or other arrangements that could trigger a requirement for an early payment, additional collateral support, changes in terms, acceleration of maturity, or the creation of an additional financial obligation, such as adverse changes in the registrant's credit rating, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows, or stock price, or changes in the value of underlying, linked or indexed assets.
1~2632~2635~H|H2.|(e)|(9)|b.~circumstances that could impair the registrant's ability to continue to engage in transactions that have been integral to historical operations or are financially or operationally essential, or that could render that activity commercially impracticable, such as the inability to maintain a specified investment grade credit rating, level of earnings, earnings per share, financial ratios, or collateral.
1~2632~2636~H|H2.|(e)|(9)|c.~factors specific to the registrant and its markets that the registrant expects to be given significant weight in the determination of the registrant's credit rating or will otherwise affect the registrant's ability to raise short-term and long-term financing.
1~2632~2637~H|H2.|(e)|(9)|d.~guarantees of debt or other commitments to third parties.
1~2632~2638~H|H2.|(e)|(9)|e.~written options on non-financial assets (for example, real estate puts).
1~2632~2639~H|H2.|(e)|(9)|e.~<U>Note</U>: At the 2011 AICPA National Conference on Current SEC and PCAOB Developments, members of the SEC staff suggested registrants asserting indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings disclose the amount of cash and short-term investments currently held by these subsidiaries. This disclosure is intended to highlight the possibility that cash and short-term investments may be currently unavailable to fund domestic operations or obligations without incurring a significant amount of taxes upon repatriation.
1~2616~2640~H|H2.|(e)|(10)~Describe how significant changes in the economic environment, such as interest rates, would affect the company, including such matters as the ability to finance its costs of capital.
1~2616~2641~H|H2.|(e)|(11)~Describe internal and external sources of liquidity, including any material unused sources of liquid assets, such as unused credit lines.
1~2616~2642~H|H2.|(e)|(12)~Describe amount and purpose of material commitments for capital expenditures as of the end of the latest fiscal period, along with anticipated source of funds.
1~2616~2643~H|H2.|(e)|(13)~Describe material trends in capital resources, including expected changes in mix and relative cost of such resources.
1~2616~2644~H|H2.|(e)|(14)~Describe the effects on the registrant's liquidity and capital resources of expected expenditures in light of expected timing of reimbursements by third parties related to environmental contingencies.
1~2616~2645~H|H2.|(e)|(14)~<U>Note</U>: The disclosure of a particular risk factor or other potential developments must include an explanation of its consequences - reference to footnote disclosure is insufficient.'
1~2616~2646~H|H2.|(e)|(15)~Disclose participation in high yield financings, highly leveraged transactions, or non-investment grade loans and investments.
1~2616~2647~H|H2.|(e)|(16)~Discuss the impact of restrictive debt covenants.
1~2616~2648~H|H2.|(e)|(17)~If factors indicate that there may have been, or is, substantial doubt as to the company's ability to continue as a going concern, management's plan should be discussed.

1~2649~2650~H|H2.|(e)|(18)|a.~In a separately-captioned section, discuss the company's off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the registrant's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors. Examples of off-balance-sheet arrangements include financial guarantees; subordinated retained interests; keepwell agreements; derivative agreements; embedded derivatives, or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to continuing risks or material contingent liabilities.
1~2649~2651~H|H2.|(e)|(18)|b.~To the extent necessary to obtain an understanding of such arrangements and the effect, disclose the following:
1~2651~2652~H|H2.|(e)|(18)|b.|i)~The nature and business purpose of such off-balance sheet arrangements.

1~2651~2655~H|H2.|(e)|(18)|b.|iv)~Any known event, demand, commitment, trend, or uncertainty that will result in or is reasonably likely to result in the termination, or material reduction in availability, of the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements that provide material benefits to it, and the course of action that the Company has taken or proposes to take in response to any such circumstances.
1~2616~2656~H|H2.|(e)|(19)~The SEC has indicated that registrants should expand their MD&A to describe:
1~2656~2657~H|H2.|(e)|(19)|a.~The specific factors used to determine whether unrealized losses were considered to be temporary and when they were considered other-than-temporary.

1~2616~2670~H|H2.|(e)|(21)~If the registrant's liquidity is dependent on the use of off-balance sheet financing arrangements, such as securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities, the registrant should consider disclosure of the factors that are reasonably likely to affect its ability to continue using those off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1~2616~2671~H|H2.|(e)|(22)~Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments - In FRR 61, the SEC indicated that they believe investors would find it useful if aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments were provided in a single location. This could be presented in the form of schedules of contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the latest balance sheet date.
1~2616~2672~H|H2.|(e)|(22)~<U>Note</U>: In 2003, the SEC issued FRR 67. Although the table in FRR 61 regarding other commercial commitments was not superseded by the FRR 67, the SEC has indicated that registrants should consider, based on their particular facts and circumstances, whether the table is beneficial to investors. If the table would be beneficial, it should be provided in accordance with the existing guidance in FRR 61.

1~2699~2701~H|H2.|(e)|(24)|b.~The amount and reason for any material increase or decrease in Level 3 assets and liabilities resulting from the transfer of assets and liabilities from, or into, Level 1 or Level 2.
1~2699~2702~H|H2.|(e)|(24)|c.~If a material amount of assets or liabilities have been transferred into Level 3 during the period, a discussion of:
1~2702~2703~H|H2.|(e)|(24)|c.|i)~The significant inputs that are no longer considered to be observable; and
1~2702~2704~H|H2.|(e)|(24)|c.|ii)~Any material gain or loss recognized on those assets or liabilities during the period, and, to the extent the registrant excluded that amount from the realized/unrealized gains (losses) line item in the Level 3 reconciliation, the amount that was excluded.
1~2699~2705~H|H2.|(e)|(24)|d.~With regard to Level 3 assets or liabilities, a discussion of, to the extent material:
1~2705~2706~H|H2.|(e)|(24)|d.|i)~whether realized and unrealized gains (losses) affected the results of operations, liquidity or capital resources during the period, and if so, how;
1~2705~2707~H|H2.|(e)|(24)|d.|ii)~the reason for any material decline or increase in the fair values; and
1~2705~2708~H|H2.|(e)|(24)|d.|iii)~whether the registrant believes that the fair values diverge materially from the amounts that it currently anticipates realizing on settlement or maturity. If so, disclose why and provide the basis for the difference.

1~2710~2711~H|H2.|(e)|(25)|a.~A general description of the valuation techniques or models used with regard to material assets or liabilities. Consider describing any material changes made during the reporting period to those techniques or models, why the change was made, and, to the extent possible, the quantitative effect of those changes.
1~2710~2712~H|H2.|(e)|(25)|b.~To the extent material, a discussion of the extent to which, and how, the registrant used or considered relevant market indices, for example ABX or CMBX, in applying the techniques or models used to value material assets or liabilities. Consider describing any material adjustments made during the reporting period to the fair value of assets or liabilities based on market indices and the reasons for making those adjustments.
1~2710~2713~H|H2.|(e)|(25)|c.~A discussion of how the registrant has validated the techniques or models utilized.
1~2710~2714~H|H2.|(e)|(25)|d.~A discussion of how sensitive the fair value estimates for material assets or liabilities are to the significant inputs the technique or model uses. For example, consider providing a range of values around the fair value amount arrived at to provide a sense of how the fair value estimate could potentially change as the significant inputs vary. To the extent an entity provides a range, it should discuss why it believes the range is appropriate, identifying the key drivers of variability, and discussing how it developed the inputs used in determining the range.
1~2710~2715~H|H2.|(e)|(25)|e.~If material, a discussion of how increases and decreases in the aggregate fair value of assets and liabilities may affect liquidity and capital resources.
1~2616~2716~H|H2.|(e)|(26)~To the extent material to the registrant's own facts and circumstances, disclose in MD&A:
1~2716~2717~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|a.~The significant judgments made in classifying a particular financial instrument in the fair value hierarchy.
1~2716~2718~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|b.~An explanation of how credit risk is incorporated and considered in the valuation of assets or liabilities - whether under ASC 825 or other applicable standards.'
1~2716~2719~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|c.~ASC 825 requires disclosure about the gain/loss on items the registrant has elected to carry at fair value but not on those items required to carry at fair value - such as derivative instruments accounted for under ASC 815. If material to the results of operations, consider disclosing the gains or losses on financial instruments that are required to be carried at fair value and explain:'
1~2719~2720~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|c.|i)~How credit risk affected the valuation of derivative liabilities and the resulting gain or loss that is included in earnings relating to the changes in that credit risk; and
1~2719~2721~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|c.|ii)~How counterparty credit risk affected the valuation of derivative assets and the resulting gain or loss that is included in earnings relating to the changes in that credit risk. Also, consider discussing how deterioration in the counterparty's credit and the registrant's ability to collect on a derivative asset will impact the financial statements.
1~2719~2722~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|c.|iii)~The location of this information can facilitate an understanding of the impact on the financial statements. Accordingly, the registrant may want to discuss the implications of items it has elected to carry at fair value with the items that are required to be carried at fair value.
1~2716~2723~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|d.~The criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive (i.e., illiquid).
1~2716~2724~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|e.~Which financial instruments are affected by the lack of market liquidity (i.e., inactivity), how the lack of liquidity impacted the valuation technique used, and how the registrant factored illiquidity into the fair value determination of those financial instruments.
1~2716~2725~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|f.~If the registrant discloses that it utilizes brokers or pricing services to assist in determining fair values, consider explaining the extent to which, and how, the information is obtained and used in developing the fair value measurements in the consolidated financial statements. The nature and form of this information may vary depending on the facts and circumstances, but may include the following:
1~2725~2726~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|f.|i)~The nature and amount of assets valued using broker quotes or prices obtained from pricing services, along with the classification in the fair value hierarchy;
1~2725~2727~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|f.|ii)~The number of quotes or prices generally obtained per instrument, and if the registrant obtained multiple quotes or prices, how it determined the ultimate value used in the financial statements;
1~2725~2728~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|f.|iii)~Whether, and if so, how and why, the registrant adjusted quotes or prices obtained from brokers and pricing services;
1~2725~2729~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|f.|iv)~The extent to which the brokers or pricing services are gathering observable market information as opposed to using unobservable inputs and/or proprietary models in making valuation judgments and determinations;
1~2725~2730~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|f.|v)~Whether the broker quotes are binding or non-binding; and
1~2725~2731~H|H2.|(e)|(26)|f.|vi)~The procedures performed to validate the prices obtained to ensure the fair value determination is consistent with ASC 820, and to ensure that the registrant has properly classified its assets and liabilities in the fair value hierarchy.
1~2739~2740~H|H2.|(f)|(7)|a.~Shipments of product at the end of a reporting period that significantly reduce customer backlog and that reasonably might be expected to result in lower shipments and revenue in the next period.
1~2739~2741~H|H2.|(f)|(7)|b.~Granting of extended payment terms that will result in a longer collection period for accounts receivable (regardless of whether revenue has been recognized) and slower cash inflows from operations, and the effect on liquidity and capital resources.
1~2739~2742~H|H2.|(f)|(7)|c.~Changing trends in shipments into, and sales from, a sales channel or separate class of customer that could be expected to have a significant effect on future sales or sales returns.
1~2739~2743~H|H2.|(f)|(7)|d.~An increasing trend toward sales to a different class of customer, such as a reseller distribution channel that has a lower gross profit margin than existing sales that are principally made to end users. Also, increasing service revenue that has a higher profit margin than product sales.
1~2739~2744~H|H2.|(f)|(7)|e.~Seasonal trends or variations in sales.
1~2749~2750~H|H2.|(f)|(12)|a.~Changes in the quantity or type of instruments used in share-based payment programs, such as a shift from share options to restricted shares;

1~2749~2752~H|H2.|(f)|(12)|c.~Total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized and the weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized.
1~2599~2753~H|H2.|(g)~Environmental and product liabilities:
1~2753~2754~H|H2.|(g)|(1)~Environmental:
1~2754~2755~H|H2.|(g)|(1)|a.~Describe the effects on the registrant's liquidity and capital resources of expected expenditures in light of expected timing of reimbursements by third parties related to environmental contingencies.
1~2754~2756~H|H2.|(g)|(1)|b.~Describe potential environmental cleanup liabilities that have had or are likely to have a material effect on revenues or income from continuing operations. To the extent material, describe separately:
1~2756~2757~H|H2.|(g)|(1)|b.|i)~Recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution in on-going operations.
1~2756~2758~H|H2.|(g)|(1)|b.|ii)~Capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances or pollutants.

1~2754~2761~H|H2.|(g)|(1)|c.~Disaggregated disclosures that describe accrued and reasonably likely losses with respect to particular environmental sites that are individually material may be necessary for a full understanding of these contingencies.
1~2754~2762~H|H2.|(g)|(1)|d.~Disclose if it is reasonably possible that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized may be incurred and if the resulting loss would be material.
1~2754~2763~H|H2.|(g)|(1)|e.~If management's investigation of potential liability and remediation costs is at different stages with respect to individual sites, the consequences of this with respect to amounts accrued and disclosed should be discussed.
1~2754~2764~H|H2.|(g)|(1)|f.~Disclose significant exposure for asbestos treatment costs.
1~2754~2765~H|H2.|(g)|(1)|g.~A company designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for cleaning up a contaminated site is required to consider the adequacy of its disclosure in light of the possible liability. If material, the matter, including quantification of the potential exposure to the extent practicable, should be discussed.
1~2754~2766~H|H2.|(g)|(1)|h.~Provide a meaningful analysis as to why the amounts charged in each period were recorded and how the amounts were determined.
1~2753~2767~H|H2.|(g)|(2)~Product Liabilities:
1~2767~2768~H|H2.|(g)|(2)|a.~Disclosures relevant to an understanding of historical and anticipated product liability costs include:
1~2768~2769~H|H2.|(g)|(2)|a.|i)~The nature of personal injury or property damages alleged by claimants.
1~2768~2770~H|H2.|(g)|(2)|a.|ii)~Aggregate settlement costs by type of claim.
1~2768~2771~H|H2.|(g)|(2)|a.|iii)~Related costs of administering and litigating claims.
1~2768~2772~H|H2.|(g)|(2)|a.|iv)~Consider also if the potential loss relating to product liability claims will have a significant impact on the value of any related intangible asset (e.g., intellectual property intangible asset associated with litigation for product liability).
1~2768~2773~H|H2.|(g)|(2)|a.|iv)~<U>Note</U>: Disaggregated disclosures that describe accrued and reasonably likely losses with respect to particular claims may be necessary if they are individually material.
1~2768~2774~H|H2.|(g)|(2)|a.|v)~If the contingency involves a large number of relatively small individual claims of a similar type, such as personal injury from exposure to asbestos, consider disclosing:
1~2774~2775~H|H2.|(g)|(2)|a.|v)|1)~The number of claims pending at each balance sheet date.
1~2774~2776~H|H2.|(g)|(2)|a.|v)|2)~The number of claims filed for each period presented.

1~2774~2779~H|H2.|(g)|(2)|a.|v)|4)~<U>Note</U>: Disclosures should address historical and expected trends in these amounts and their reasonably likely effects on operating results, liquidity, and financial condition.
1~2767~2780~H|H2.|(g)|(2)|b.~Include appropriate disclosure regarding any unrecognized preacquisition contingency and its reasonably likely effects on operating results, liquidity, and financial condition.
1~2767~2781~H|H2.|(g)|(2)|c.~Provide a meaningful analysis as to why the amounts charged in each period were recorded and how the amounts were determined.
1~2767~2782~H|H2.|(g)|(2)|c.~<U>Note</U>: "Disaggregated" information should be presented to the extent needed to fully understand a registrant's business.
1~2599~2783~H|H2.|(h)~Impact of recently issued accounting standards.
1~2599~2784~H|H2.|(i)~Foreign operations and translation: Consider the need for additional disclosures relating to foreign operations and foreign currency translation effects as discussed in FRR 6. These disclosures might include, among other things, the effects of and exposure to foreign currency rate changes and information as to functional currencies, with an emphasis on how such matters may affect the company's operations. Such disclosures may be presented as part of this discussion, with segment information, or elsewhere at the discretion of the registrant.
1~2599~2785~H|H2.|(j)~Disclosure related to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements:
1~2785~2786~H|H2.|(j)|(1)~Any material impact on liquidity and operations or risk stemming from significant exposure as a result of repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.

1~2599~2788~H|H2.|(k)~Restructuring charges:
1~2788~2789~H|H2.|(k)|(1)~Discuss the events and decisions which gave rise to the restructuring, the nature of the charge and the expected impact of the restructuring on future results of operations, liquidity, and sources and uses of capital resources. Disclosure of the effects of unusual or infrequent items on income and earnings per share are beneficial to a reader's understanding of the financial statements and are, therefore, acceptable. See also checklist item B20(s), for certain employee termination benefits and costs to exit an activity (including certain costs incurred in restructuring).
1~2788~2790~H|H2.|(k)|(2)~The SEC staff indicated the disclosures should include:
1~2790~2791~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|a.~Disclose the nature and amounts of the types of exit costs and other types of restructuring charges that appear quantitatively or qualitatively material. Losses related to asset impairments should be identified separately from charges based on estimates of future cash expenditures.
1~2790~2792~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|b.~Discuss the reasonably likely material effects on future earnings and cash flows resulting from the plans (for example, reduced depreciation, reduced employee expense, etc.). The Company should quantify and disclose these effects and disclose when they expect those effects to be realized. If anticipated reductions in costs are reasonably likely to be offset to some degree by reduced revenues or increases in other expenses, they should also be discussed and quantified to the extent practicable.
1~2790~2793~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|c.~In periods subsequent to the initiation date, changes in the restructuring plan and estimates of the costs of the plan in future years. Changes and activity in the liability balance either as a result of expenditures or changes in/reversals of estimates or the fair value of the liability should be disclosed.
1~2790~2794~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|d.~Provide a discussion of the nature, amount, and description for each material component of total restructuring charges. The SEC staff often requests a presentation and analysis of restructuring charges in tabular form.
1~2790~2795~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|d.~Include the following in the MD&A regarding restructuring charges:
1~2790~2796~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|d.~<U>Note</U>: The SEC staff often has requested greater disaggregation and more precise labeling when exit and involuntary termination costs are grouped in a note or income statement line item with items unrelated to the exit plan.
1~2790~2797~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|e.~In the event a company recognized liabilities for exit costs and involuntary employee termination benefits relating to multiple exit plans, present separate information for each individual exit plan that has a material effect on the balance sheet, results of operations, or cash flows.
1~2790~2798~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|f.~Whether or not currently recognizable in the financial statements, material exit or involuntary termination costs that affect a known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty to management, should be disclosed in MD&A.
1~2790~2799~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|g.~MD&A should include discussion of the events and decisions which gave rise to the exit costs and exit plan, and the likely effects of management's plans on financial position, future operating results, and liquidity, unless it is determined that a material effect is not reasonably likely to occur.
1~2790~2800~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|h.~Registrants should identify the periods in which material cash outlays are anticipated and the expected source of their funding. Registrants should also discuss material revisions to exit plans, exit costs, or the timing of the plan's execution, including the nature and reasons for the revisions.
1~2790~2801~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|i.~The expected effects on future earnings and cash flows resulting from the exit plan should be quantified and disclosed, along with the initial period in which those effects are expected to be realized. This includes whether the cost savings are expected to be offset by anticipated increases in other expenses or reduced revenues. This discussion should clearly identify the income statement line items to be impacted. In later periods, if actual savings anticipated by the exit plan are not achieved as expected or are achieved in periods other than as expected, MD&A should discuss that outcome, its reasons, and its likely effects on future operating results and liquidity.
1~2790~2802~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|j.~For material exit or involuntary employee termination costs related to an acquired business, the staff has requested disclosure in either MD&A or the financial statements of:
1~2802~2803~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|j.|i)~When the registrant began formulating exit plans for which accrual may be necessary.
1~2802~2804~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|j.|ii)~The types and amounts of liabilities recognized for exit costs and involuntary employee termination benefits and included in the acquisition cost allocation.
1~2802~2805~H|H2.|(k)|(2)|j.|iii)~Any unresolved contingencies or purchase price allocation issues and the types of additional liabilities that may result in an adjustment of the acquisition cost allocation.
1~2788~2806~H|H2.|(k)|(3)~To the extent restructuring charges were recorded in prior years, and cost savings have failed to come to fruition, consider the need to disclose that event.
1~2599~2807~H|H2.|(l)~Consider the need to disclose the nature and extent of a registrant's involvement with high yield or highly leveraged transactions and noninvestment grade loans and investments.
1~2599~2808~H|H2.|(m)~Consider the need to disclose the effects of federal financial assistance on operations. (Many financial institutions, such as thrifts and banks, receive financial assistance in connection with federally assisted acquisitions or restructurings.)
1~2599~2809~H|H2.|(n)~For business combinations, any material effects on results of operations, liquidity, capital resources and known trends, commitments, or contingencies.
1~2599~2810~H|H2.|(o)~The SEC has required disclosure of the basis for recognition or nonrecognition of deferred tax assets through use of a valuation account if it is not apparent from the underlying financial statements.
1~2599~2811~H|H2.|(p)~For registrants with material deferred tax assets where existing levels of income do not appear sufficient to ensure realizability of the deferred tax asset:
1~2811~2812~H|H2.|(p)|(1)~A discussion of the minimum amount of future taxable income that would need to be generated to realize the deferred tax asset and whether the existing levels of pretax earnings for financial reporting purposes are sufficient to generate that minimum amount of future taxable income.
1~2811~2813~H|H2.|(p)|(2)~A description of operating improvements necessary to realize the deferred tax asset.

1~2837~2851~H|H2.|(s)|(2)|m.~Fair Value - When quoted market prices are not available for assets where fair value must be recorded and registrants use other valuation techniques, those valuation techniques, assumptions, and estimations should be disclosed.
1~2599~2852~H|H2.|(t)~Disclosures about certain trading activities that include non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value:
1~2852~2853~H|H2.|(t)|(1)~Registrants engaged in trading activities involving commodity contracts that are accounted for at fair value, but for which a lack of market price quotations necessitates the use of fair value estimation techniques should consider providing MD&A disclosures to supplement those required in the financial statements.
1~2852~2854~H|H2.|(t)|(2)~Information in the disclosures should include any contracts that are derivatives involving the same commodities that are part of those trading activities.
1~2852~2855~H|H2.|(t)|(3)~Registrants should consider the need to furnish information, quantified to the extent practicable, that does the following:
1~2855~2856~H|H2.|(t)|(3)|a.~disaggregates realized and unrealized changes in fair value.
1~2855~2857~H|H2.|(t)|(3)|b.~identifies changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques.
1~2855~2858~H|H2.|(t)|(3)|c.~disaggregates estimated fair values at the latest balance sheet date based on whether fair values are determined directly from quoted market prices or are estimated.
1~2855~2859~H|H2.|(t)|(3)|d.~indicates the maturities of contracts at the latest balance sheet date (e.g., within one year, within years 1-3, within years 4 and 5, and after five years).

1~2852~2861~H|H2.|(t)|(5)~Consider additional disclosure regarding management of risks related to, for example, changes in credit quality or market fluctuations of underlying, linked or indexed assets or liabilities, especially where such assets are illiquid or susceptible to material uncertainties in valuation.
1~2599~2862~H|H2.|(u)~Disclosures about effects of transactions with related parties and certain other parties:
1~2862~2863~H|H2.|(u)|(1)~Registrants should consider whether investors would better understand the financial statements if MD&A provided descriptions of all material transactions involving related persons or entities with clear discussions of arrangements that may involve transaction terms or other aspects that differ from those which would likely be negotiated with clearly independent parties. Registrants should also consider describing the elements of the transactions that are necessary for an understanding of the transactions' business purpose and economic substance, their effects on the financial statements, and the special risks or contingencies arising from those transactions. Disclosure of the following may be necessary:
1~2863~2864~H|H2.|(u)|(1)|a.~The business purpose of the arrangement.
1~2863~2865~H|H2.|(u)|(1)|b.~Identification of the related parties transacting business with the registrant.

1~2862~2869~H|H2.|(u)|(2)~Consider the need for disclosure about parties that fall outside of the definition of "related parties," but with whom the registrant, or its related parties, have a relationship that enables the parties to negotiate terms of material transactions that may not be available from other, more clearly independent parties on an arms-length basis. Consider a clear explanation of these relationships and arrangements.

1~3190~3191~J|J1.~<B>Separate Financial Statements for Unconsolidated Subsidiaries and 50 Percent-or-Less-Owned Persons:</B>
1~3191~3192~J|J1.|(a)~Refer to the "significant subsidiary" criteria in S-X 1-02(w), which are used to determine whether certain footnote disclosures are required (pursuant to S-X 4-08(g)) for unconsolidated subsidiaries and 50 percent-or-less-owned persons accounted for by the equity method.
1~3191~3193~J|J1.|(b)~If required, these separate statements are subject to the following specifications:
1~3193~3194~J|J1.|(b)|(1)~Should comply with Regulation S-X, including footnote disclosures and supporting financial statement schedules as applicable. However, if the 50 percent-or-less-owned person is a foreign business, financial statements of the business meeting the requirements of Item 17 of Form 20-F are satisfactory.
1~3193~3195~J|J1.|(b)|(2)~Should be as of the same dates and for the same periods as the primary financial statements (insofar as practicable).
1~3193~3196~J|J1.|(b)|(3)~Need be audited for only those years in which the appropriate tests in S-X 1-02(w), substituting 20 percent for 10 percent, have been met.
1~3193~3197~J|J1.|(b)|(4)~If the fiscal year of any 50 percent-or-less-owned person ends within the registrant's number of filing days before the date of the filing, or if the fiscal year ends after the date of the filing, the required financial statements may be filed as an amendment to the report within the subsidiary's number of filing days, or within six months if the 50 percent-or-less-owned person is a foreign business, after the end of such subsidiary's or person's fiscal year.
1~3193~3198~J|J1.|(b)|(4)~<U>Note</U>: If the entity has the same fiscal year-end as the registrant, and if the unconsolidated subsidiary or equity investee is not an accelerated filer, the financial statements of that subsidiary or investee can be filed by way of an amendment to the Form 10-K within the currently specified periods.
1~3193~3199~J|J1.|(b)|(5)~The financial statements of two or more individually "significant" unconsolidated subsidiaries or 50 percent-or-less-owned persons may be combined or consolidated, provided that the resulting financial statements clearly exhibit the financial position, cash flows, and results of operations of the combined or consolidated group. Note, however, that the statements of unconsolidated subsidiaries may <U>not</U> be combined with those of 50 percent-or-less- owned persons.
1~3193~3200~J|J1.|(b)|(6)~Should include disclosure of the amounts of related party transactions that are (i) eliminated and (ii) not eliminated in the related consolidated financial statements. Should also include disclosure of the effects of any intercompany profits and losses that are not eliminated.
1~3190~3201~J|J2.~<B>Separate Financial Statements for Guarantors</B>:
1~3190~3202~J|J2.~<U>Note</U>: Paragraph (a) of S-X 3-10 contains the general rule that every issuer of a registered security that is guaranteed and every guarantor of a registered security must file the financial statements required for a registrant by Regulation S-X. Paragraphs (b) through (f) of S-X 3-10 provide exceptions to the general rule. <B>(REQUIRED FOR SRCs.)</B> Financial statements for a subsidiary of a smaller reporting company that issues securities guaranteed by the smaller reporting company must be presented as required by S-X 3-10, except the periods presented are based on S-X 8-02."
1~3201~3203~J|J2.|(a)~Must be provided for:
1~3203~3204~J|J2.|(a)|(1)~Each guarantor of any class of securities of the registrant.
1~3201~3205~J|J2.|(b)~Separate financial statements need not be filed if these statements are otherwise separately included in the filing on an individual basis or on a basis consolidated with its subsidiaries.
1~3201~3206~J|J2.|(c)~If required:
1~3206~3207~J|J2.|(c)|(1)~Should comply with Regulation S-X, including footnote disclosures and supporting financial statement schedules, as applicable.
1~3206~3208~J|J2.|(c)|(2)~Should be audited.
1~3206~3209~J|J2.|(c)|(3)~Should include disclosure of the amounts of related party transactions that are (i) eliminated and (ii) not eliminated in the related consolidated financial statements. Should also include disclosure of the effects of any intercompany profits and losses that are not eliminated.
1~3201~3210~J|J2.|(d)~Separate financial statements are not required for related issuers and guarantors in certain circumstances. In those instances, provide disclosure of condensed consolidating information or narrative disclosures in lieu of full financial statements in accordance with the requirements of S-X 3-10.
1~3201~3211~J|J2.|(d)~<U>Note 1</U>: A guarantor may be exempted from filing its separate financial statements under S-X 3-10 but still be required to file under S-X 3-16.
1~3201~3212~J|J2.|(d)~<U>Note 2</U>: Considering whether a relevant guarantee is full and unconditional - A guarantee is full and unconditional if, when an issuer of a guaranteed security has failed to make a scheduled payment, the guarantor is obligated to make the scheduled payments immediately and if the guarantor does not, any holder of the guaranteed security may immediately bring suit for all amounts due and payable (S-X 3-10 (h)). An arrangement that permits a guarantor to opt out of its obligations prior to or during the term of the debt is not a full and unconditional guarantee (see SEC FRM 2510.4). For example, if a parent guarantor can unilaterally eliminate its guarantee of a subsidiary issuer's registered debt, then that guarantee would not be considered full and unconditional. Whether a guarantee is full and unconditional is a legal determination and should be discussed with the registrant and its SEC counsel.
1~3190~3213~J|J3.~<B>Financial statements of predecessor companies.</B>
1~3190~3214~J|J4.~<B>Financial Statements Required by SAB 71 (Properties Securing Mortgage Loans).</B>

1~3190~3217~J|J7.~<B>Separate Financial Statements for Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize Registered Securities</B>: <B>(REQUIRED FOR SRCs.)</B> Financial statements for a smaller reporting company's affiliate whose securities constitute a substantial portion of the collateral for any class of securities registered must be presented as required by S-X 3-16, except the periods presented are based on S-X 8-02."
1~3217~3218~J|J7.|(a)~For each of the registrant's affiliates whose securities constitute a substantial portion of the collateral for any class of securities registered or being registered, there shall be filed the financial statements that would be required if the affiliate were a registrant and required to file financial statements. However, financial statements need not be filed for any person whose statements are otherwise separately included in the filing on an individual basis or on a basis consolidated with its subsidiaries.
1~3217~3219~J|J7.|(b)~For the purposes of this section, securities of a person shall be deemed to constitute a substantial portion of collateral if the aggregate principal amount, par value, or book value of the securities as carried by the registrant, or the market value of such securities, whichever is the greatest, equals 20 percent or more of the principal amount of the secured class of securities.
1~3217~3220~J|J7.|(b)~
1~3221~3222~K|K1.~<B>Auditors' Reports-General:</B>

1~3223~3226~K|K1.|(a)|(3)~Any separate financial statements included for unconsolidated subsidiaries, 50 percent-or-less- owned persons, or other entities.
1~3223~3227~K|K1.|(a)|(3)~<U>Note</U>: Refer to PwC Audit 10078 for discussion and illustrative wording of auditors' reports when we are the successor auditors and have performed a "modifications only" audit of prior period financial statements.
1~3222~3228~K|K1.|(b)~Address the report as required by the circumstances of the engagement, such as to:
1~3228~3229~K|K1.|(b)|(1)~The Board of Directors and Shareholders (or Stockholders);
1~3228~3230~K|K1.|(b)|(2)~The Shareholders (or Stockholders) of the company whose financial statements are being audited.
1~3222~3231~K|K1.|(c)~The auditor's report(s) should be titled, "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm."
1~3222~3232~K|K1.|(c)~<U>Note</U>: Reports issued in the state of Florida should continue to be titled, "Report of Independent Registered Certified Public Accounting Firm."
1~3222~3233~K|K1.|(d)~Include a statement in the report that the audit was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1~3222~3234~K|K1.|(e)~If the auditors' report on the primary financial statements is incorporated by reference from the annual report to shareholders, the copy of that report filed as an exhibit to Form 10-K is required.
1~3222~3235~K|K1.|(f)~For EDGAR filings, prior to the company performing the electronic transmission, provide a manually signed report and transmittal letter that indicates the date that we authorized management to associate our name with the Form 10-K.
1~3222~3236~K|K1.|(g)~For entities where we have been engaged to audit the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, provide our integrated audit report on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. When evaluating if management's report is complete and properly presented, ensure the following are included:
1~3236~3237~K|K1.|(g)|(1)~A statement of management's responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1~3236~3238~K|K1.|(g)|(2)~A statement identifying the framework used by management to conduct its evaluation (e.g., criteria established in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" (1992 or 2013, as applicable) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)).
1~3236~3239~K|K1.|(g)|(3)~A statement of whether the registrant's internal control over financial reporting is effective or ineffective as of the date of the financial statements (e.g., the date of the assessment).
1~3222~3240~K|K1.|(h)~A statement that the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements has issued a report on the effectiveness of company's internal control over financial reporting. Although there are different variations of acceptable language, the following language would meet this requirement: "The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of [date], has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein."
1~3222~3241~K|K1.|(i)~Ensure proper disclosure of entities excluded from management's assessment (e.g., as a result of FIN 46(R)/ASC 810 or purchase business combinations).
1~3222~3242~K|K1.|(j)~For entities subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, where a material weakness was previously reported, provide the independent registered public accounting firm's attestation report on whether a previously reported material weakness continues to exist.
1~3222~3243~K|K1.|(k)~A registrant need not comply with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Item until it either had been required to file an annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for the prior fiscal year or had filed an annual report with the Commission for the prior fiscal year. A registrant that does not comply shall include a statement in the first annual report that it files in substantially the following form: "This annual report does not include a report of management's assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of the company's registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for newly public companies."
1~3222~3244~K|K1.|(k)~Disclose any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the registrant's last fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
1~3221~3245~K|K2.~<B>Reports of Other Auditors:</B>
1~3245~3246~K|K2.|(a)~If the principal auditor divides responsibility with/makes reference to the report of another auditor <U>or</U> if there are periods presented that were audited by a predecessor auditor, the report of the other auditor must be included in Form 10-K. (Separate reports of other auditors need not be included in annual reports to shareholders.)
1~3221~3247~K|K3.~<B>Consents:</B>
1~3247~3248~K|K3.|(a)~Under present requirements, Form 10-K is deemed to be incorporated by reference into 1933 Act registration statements (e.g., those filed on Forms S-3 and S-8) that remain currently effective. In such situations, an accountants' consent is generally included in Form 10-K to avoid the necessity of filing an amendment to the applicable registration statement merely to provide such a consent.
1~3247~3249~K|K3.|(a)~<U>Note</U>: Our report included in Form 10-K that is incorporated by reference in a 1933 Act filing (e.g., Forms S-3 or S-8) becomes subject to the "Keeping Current" provisions of the 1933 Act. Each filing of the Form 10-K that is incorporated by reference in a registration statement is considered a new registration statement and, therefore, creates a new effective date. Accordingly, when a Form 10-K is filed after the original effective date of the Form S-3, or S-8 registration statement, the independent accountant must perform a "Keeping Current" review through the date the Form 10-K is filed.
1~3247~3250~K|K3.|(b)~If the financial statements in a 1933 Act registration statement are incorporated by reference into Form 10-K, an accountants' consent to such incorporation is required to be included in Form 10-K.
1~3221~3251~K|K4.~<B>Consistency Reference:</B>
1~3221~3252~K|K4.~Disclose those circumstances in which accounting principles have not been consistently observed in the current period in relation to the preceding period.
1~3221~3253~K|K4.~<U>Note</U>: It would not be sufficient to make a general reference in the auditor's report merely to the fact that the company has changed certain accounting policies with a note reference (e.g., "As discussed in Note X to the financial statements, the Company changed certain methods of accounting"). The auditor's report should also make reference to the matter of change.
1~3251~3254~K|K4.|(a)~Each time a client changes an accounting principle or changes the method of applying an accounting principle, consider whether the change should be highlighted in the auditor's report, and if so, for how long that explanatory paragraph should remain in the auditor's report.
1~3251~3255~K|K4.|(b)~Changes in accounting principles or the methods of applying them that result in the retrospective adjustment of all periods presented are required to be disclosed with a consistency paragraph in the auditor's report if the impact on either the current period or prior period financial statements is material. However, the consistency reference in the auditor's report would only be required in the year of the change because in subsequent years all periods presented will be comparable.
1~3251~3256~K|K4.|(c)~Changes in accounting principles or the method of applying them which do not result in the restatement of prior period balances and amounts for comparative purposes result in the inclusion of a consistency reference in the auditor's report if there is either:
1~3256~3257~K|K4.|(c)|(1)~A material cumulative effect recorded upon adoption/change, or
1~3256~3258~K|K4.|(c)|(2)~A material impact on the financial statements in the year of adoption.
1~3251~3259~K|K4.|(d)~Disclose the consistency paragraph, required by (c) immediately above, in the auditor's report in the year of adoption and in subsequent years until:
1~3259~3260~K|K4.|(d)|(1)~the financial statements for all periods presented have been prepared using the new principle and
1~3259~3261~K|K4.|(d)|(2)~the cumulative effect of the accounting change, if any, is no longer presented.
1~3221~3262~K|K5.~<B>Preferability Letter on Discretionary Accounting Change:</B>
1~3221~3263~K|K5.~If a discretionary change in accounting principle has been made during the latest fiscal year, a letter from the independent accountant commenting on the preferability of the change must be included as an exhibit to Form 10-K unless such a letter was included in a previously filed Form 10-Q. Preferability letters need not be furnished, however, in connection with accounting changes required by a standard adopted by the FASB or for a change in estimate effected by a change in accounting principle (for the latter, this type of change may only be made if it is justifiable on the basis that it is preferable).
1~3221~3264~K|K6.~<B>Certification of Disclosure in Annual Reports:</B>
1~3264~3265~K|K6.|(a)~Each report on Form 10-K other than a report filed by an Asset-Backed Issuer, must include a certification. Each principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers of the issuer, or person performing similar functions at the time of the filing of the report, must sign the certification.
1~3264~3266~K|K6.|(a)~<U>Note</U>: Certifications under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are required to be filed as exhibits.
1~3264~3267~K|K6.|(b)~The certification included in each report must be in the form specified and consist of a statement of the certifying officer in following form:

1~3268~3277~K|K6.|(b)|(1)|e.~He or she and the other certifying officers have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the issuer's auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors (or persons fulfilling the equivalent function):
1~3277~3278~K|K6.|(b)|(1)|e.|i)~All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the issuer's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial information, and
1~3277~3279~K|K6.|(b)|(1)|e.|ii)~Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the issuer's internal control over financial reporting.

1~3291~3296~K|K6.|(c)|(5)~Issuers of asset-backed securities have an obligation to file periodic reports under Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for some period of time. Due to the nature of issuers of asset-backed securities, however, the Staff of the Division of Corporation Finance has historically granted requests permitting such issuers to satisfy their Exchange Act reporting responsibilities under a modified structure. The modified structure generally requires issuers of asset-backed securities to file reports with:
1~3296~3297~K|K6.|(c)|(5)|a.~A copy of the servicing or distribution report that is required by the pooling and servicing agreement;
1~3296~3298~K|K6.|(c)|(5)|b.~Annual statements from the servicer or other relevant entity as to its compliance with its obligations under the pooling and servicing agreement;
1~3296~3299~K|K6.|(c)|(5)|c.~A statement from an independent accountant as to compliance by the servicer with particular servicing standards;
1~3296~3300~K|K6.|(c)|(5)|d.~Information on the performance of the assets, payments on the asset-backed securities, and any other material developments that affect the issuer.
